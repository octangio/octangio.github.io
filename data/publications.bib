    abstract = {   This study aims to develop a new method to quantify nonperfused retinal capillaries (NPCs) and evaluate NPCs in eyes with AMD and diabetic retinopathy (DR).    We averaged multiple registered optical coherence tomography (OCT)/OCT angiography (OCTA) scans to create high-definition volumes. The deep capillary plexus slab was defined and segmented. A developed deep learning denoising algorithm removed tissue background noise from capillaries in en face OCT/OCTA. The algorithm segmented NPCs by identifying capillaries from OCT without corresponding flow signals in OCTA. We then investigated the relationships between NPCs and known features in AMD and DR.    The segmented NPC achieved an accuracy of 88.2\% compared to manual grading of NPCs in DR. Compared to healthy controls, both the mean number and total length (mm) of NPCs was significantly increased in AMD and DR eyes (P \&lt; 0.001, P \&lt; 0.001). Compared to early and intermediate AMD, the number and total length of NPCs were significantly higher in advanced AMD (number: P \&lt; 0.001, P \&lt; 0.001; total length: P = 0.002, P = 0.003). Geography atrophy, macular neovascularization, drusen volume, and extrafoveal avascular area (EAA) significantly correlated with increased NPCs (P \&lt; 0.05). In DR eyes, NPCs correlated with the number of microaneurysms and EAA (P \&lt; 0.05). The presence of fluid did not significantly correlate with NPCs in AMD and DR.    A deep learning-based algorithm can segment and quantify retinal capillaries that lack flow using colocalized OCT/OCTA. This new biomarker may be useful in AMD and DR in predicting progression of these diseases.  },

    abstract = { Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a signal processing and scan acquisition approach that enables OCT devices to clearly identify vascular tissue down to the capillary scale. As originally proposed, OCTA included several important limitations, including small fields of view relative to allied imaging modalities and the presence of confounding artifacts. New approaches, including both hardware and software, are solving these problems and can now produce high-quality angiograms from tissue throughout the retina and choroid. Image analysis tools have also improved, enabling OCTA data to be quantified at high precision and used to diagnose disease using deep learning models. This review highlights these advances and trends in OCTA technology, focusing on work produced since 2020. },

    abstract = {   Loss of retinal perfusion is associated with both onset and worsening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Optical coherence tomography angiography is a noninvasive method for measuring the nonperfusion area (NPA) and has promise as a scalable screening tool. This study compares two optical coherence tomography angiography algorithms for quantifying NPA.    Adults with (N = 101) and without (N = 274) DR were recruited from 20 U.S. sites. We collected 3 × 3-mm macular scans using an Optovue RTVue-XR. Rules-based (RB) and deep-learning–based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms were used to segment the NPA into four anatomical slabs. For comparison, a subset of scans (n = 50) NPA was graded manually.    The AI method outperformed the RB method in intersection over union, recall, and F1 score, but the RB method has better precision relative to manual grading in all anatomical slabs (all P ≤ 0.001). The AI method had a stronger rank correlation with Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study DR severity than the RB method in all slabs (all P \&lt; 0.001). NPAs graded using the AI method had a greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosing referable DR than the RB method in the superficial vascular complex, intermediate capillary plexus, and combined inner retina (all P ≤ 0.001), but not in the deep capillary plexus (P = 0.92).    Our results indicate that output from the AI-based method agrees better with manual grading and can better distinguish between clinically relevant DR severity levels than a RB approach using most plexuses.  },

    abstract = {   A projection-resolved optical coherence tomography angiography (PR-OCTA) algorithm with slab-specific strategy was applied in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) to differentiate between polyp and branching vascular network (BVN) and improve polyp detection by en face OCTA.    Twenty-nine participants diagnosed with PCV by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and 30 participants diagnosed with typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) were enrolled. Polyps were classified into three categories after using the slab-specific PR algorithm. Type 1 polyps were considered in high-elevated pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and displayed in green. Type 2 polyps were considered in low-elevated PED and encoded in yellow, similar to BVN structures. Type 3 polyps were not able to be detected on OCTA. The algorithms were tested in the nAMD group to differentiate PCV and typical nAMD.    With the algorithm, type 1 polyps were readily differentiated from BVN on en face OCTA. Polyp detection rate on en face OCTA only (type 1) was 68\%, which was significantly improved from 30\% when the algorithm was not used (P = 0.0001). To identify type 2 polyps, a combination of en face and cross-sectional OCTA images was needed and this resulted in a 91\% polyp detection rate (types 1 and 2). The absence of luminal structure on OCT at the polyp site, small polyp size, and absence of halo on ICGA appeared to influence the polyp detection rate. When applying the algorithm to the nAMD group, 83\% were correctly classified as typical nAMD (absence of type 1 polyps), whereas 17\% showed false detection of polyps due to flow signals at the apices of large PEDs.    The slab-specific PR-OCTA with different color coding provides significant improvement in detecting polyp structures on en face OCTA, leading to rapid coronal visualization and diagnosis of PCV without the risk of dye injection.  },

In this retrospective cross-sectional study, participants with subfoveal treatment-naïve CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration underwent OCTA. Scans were exported for custom processing including manual segmentation as necessary, application of slab subtraction and PR-OCTA algorithm, and calculation of CNV vascular area and connectivity. CNV was classified as type 1, minimally type 2, or predominantly type 2 based on fluorescein angiography (FA) and OCT. Two masked retina specialists independently classified CNV using cross-sectional conventional OCTA and PR-OCTA.    A total of 17 eyes were enrolled in this study. Mean CNV vessel area (mm2) was 0.67 ± 0.51 for PR-OCTA and 0.53 ± 0.41 for slab subtraction (P = 0.018). Mean vascular connectivity was 96.80 ± 1.28 for PR-OCTA and 90.90 ± 4.42 (P = 0.018) for slab subtraction. Within-visit repeatability (coefficient of variation) of PR-OCTA was 0.044 for CNV vessel area and 0.012 for vascular connectivity, compared to 0.093 and 0.028 by slab subtraction. PR-OCTA classification agreement with FA/OCT was 88.2\\% and 76.5\\% for the two graders, while conventional OCTA agreement was 58.8\\% and 70.6\\% (grader 1, P = 0.025; grader 2, P = 0.56). Moreover, PR-OCTA enabled the individual quantification of type 1 and type 2 components of a CNV.    PR-OCTA had greater CNV vessel area and vascular connectivity, as well as better repeatability, compared to slab subtraction, suggesting PR-OCTA is a superior technique for imaging CNV. Furthermore, PR-OCTA removes projection artifact on cross-sectional OCTA, improving the ability to classify and quantify CNV components.  }",

We have previously developed a regression-based bulk motion subtraction (rb-BMS) algorithm that estimates bulk motion velocity and corrects for its effect on flow signal. Here, we aim to investigate its ability to improve the reliability of capillary density (CD) quantification.    Two spectral-domain systems (70-kHz Avanti/AngioVue and 68-kHz Cirrus/AngioPlex) acquired 6 × 6-mm OCTA scans. The rb-BMS algorithm was applied on each OCTA volume. Regression analysis of angiographic versus reflectance signal of avascular A-lines in B-frames was used to set an optimized reflectance-adjusted threshold for discriminating vascular versus nonvascular voxels. The CD was calculated from en face maximum projections of the superficial vascular complex in macular scans and the nerve fiber layer plexus in disc scans, excluding large vessels. The retinal signal strength (RSS) was calculated by averaging the logarithmic-scale OCT reflectance signal, and its correlation with CD was investigated.    Eight healthy eyes were scanned with each instrument on 2 separate days. The rb-BMS algorithm improved within-visit repeatability and between-visit reproducibility of CD compared with a global-threshold measurement algorithm. Using the rb-BMS algorithm, the CD results were less affected by RSS and the population variation was reduced. Motion-induced line artifacts were also reduced.    The rb-BMS algorithm improved the reliability of perfusion quantification in OCTA on both Food and Drug Administration–cleared spectral-domain OCTA systems.    The rb-BMS method helped reduce the inter-scan variability by generating accurate vessel maps, improving the reliability of retinal perfusion quantification.  }",

abstract = {Purpose
This study measured and correlated degeneration of the junction between the inner and outer segments (IS/OS), the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the choriocapillaris (CC) in Stargardt disease (STGD).
Design
Prospective cross-sectional study.
Methods
This study was conducted at the Casey Eye Institute. A total of 23 patients with STGD were enrolled and underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Scans were centered on the fovea. OCT slab projections and en face boundary maps were used to create masks to measure total IS/OS loss or RPE atrophy as well as regions of isolated IS/OS loss, isolated RPE atrophy, and matched IS/OS and RPE degeneration or intact IS/OS junction and RPE. CC vascular density (CCVD) was quantified from the CC angiogram. Outcomes included the area of loss, and the CCVD of degeneration in different areas was quantified and correlated.
Results
The total area of IS/OS loss was strongly correlated with the total area of RPE atrophy (r = 0.96; P < 0.0001) by a 1.6:1 ratio (r2 = 0.90). CCVD within regions of matched degeneration (85.6% ± 2.7%; P < 0.0001), isolated IS/OS junction loss (93.6% ± 1.0%; P = 0.0011), and isolated RPE atrophy (94.1% ± 1.1%; P = 0.0065) were all significantly lower than normal (99.0% ± 0.17%). There was a trend for CCVD within intact areas (97.6% ± 0.38%) to decline as the area diminished (r = 0.68).
Conclusions
Photoreceptor and RPE degeneration exhibited a strong relationship wherein the IS/OS loss was 1.6-fold greater than that of RPE atrophy, supporting the theory that photoreceptor degeneration precedes RPE in STGD. Both the photoreceptors and the RPE degeneration contributed synergistically to CCVD attenuation, but extralesional CCVD also tended to be abnormal. The findings and techniques in this study may be of utility in developing endpoints for clinical trials.},

abstract = {Purpose
To elucidate the relationship between vessel density (VD) measurements and signal strength in OCT angiography (OCTA).
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Participants
Healthy volunteers.
Methods
OCT angiography images obtained from healthy volunteers were analyzed to demonstrate the relationship between signal strength index (SSI) and VD. Experiments were performed to determine the effects of signal strength reduction on VD measurements on the Optovue/AngioVue (Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA) and Cirrus/AngioPlex OCTA (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA) systems. Signal strength reduction was generated by either neutral density filters (NDFs) or defocus.
Main Outcome Measures
Regression analysis of signal strength effects on VD.
Results
Vessel density decreased linearly with signal strength with high statistical significance on both OCTA systems tested and for all analyzed sources of variation in signal strength. The slope of VD versus SSI was greatest when signal strength was adjusted by NDFs, followed by defocus, interscan difference, interindividual variation, and left–right eye difference. Multivariate analysis revealed that both SSI and age had a significant effect on the interindividual variation in VD.
Conclusions
Vessel density measurements using OCTA were affected significantly by OCT signal strengths on 2 OCTA platforms. Investigators should exercise caution when interpreting VD data from OCTA scans. Quantification algorithms for OCTA should ideally remove the signal strength bias.},

abstract = {Purpose
To simulate 24-2 visual field (VF) using optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) for glaucoma evaluation.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
One eye each of 39 glaucoma and 31 age-matched normal participants was scanned using 4.5-mm OCTA scans centered on the disc. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer plexus capillary density (NFLP-CD, %area) was measured. The NFLP-CD and 24-2 VF maps were divided into 8 corresponding sectors using an extension of Garway-Heath scheme.
Results
Sector NFLP-CD was transformed to a logarithmic dB scale and converted to sector simulated VF deviation maps. Comparing simulated and actual 24-2 VF maps, the worst sector was in the same or adjacent location in the same hemisphere 97% of the time. VF mean deviation (VF-MD) was simulated by NFLP mean deviation (NFLP-MD). The differences between NFLP-MD and VF-MD in early, moderate, and severe glaucoma stages were −0.9 ± 2.0, 0.9 ± 2.9, and 5.8 ± 3.2 dB. NFLP-MD had better (P = .015) between-visit reproducibility (0.63 dB pooled standard deviation) than VF-MD (1.03 dB). NFLP-MD had a significantly higher sensitivity than VF-MD (P < .001) and overall NFL thickness (P = .031).
Conclusions
OCTA-based simulated VF agreed well with actual 24-2 VF in terms of both the location and severity of glaucoma damage, with the exception of severe glaucoma in which the simulation tended to underestimate severity. The NFLP-MD had better reproducibility than actual VF-MD and holds promise for improving glaucoma monitoring. The NFLP-MD had better diagnostic accuracy than both VF-MD and overall NFL thickness and may be useful for early glaucoma diagnosis.},

abstract = {Purpose
To measure low perfusion areas (LPAs) and focal perfusion loss (FPL) in the peripapillary retina using OCT angiography (OCTA) in glaucoma.
Design
Prospective, observational study.
Participants
A total of 47 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and 36 normal participants were analyzed.
Methods
One eye of each subject was scanned using an AngioVue (Optovue, Fremont, CA) 4.5-mm OCTA scan centered on the disc. En face nerve fiber layer (NFL) plexus angiogram was generated. With the use of custom software, a capillary density map was obtained by computing the fraction of area occupied by flow pixels after low-pass filtering by local averaging 21×21 pixels. The low-perfusion map is defined by local capillary density below 0.5 percentile over a contiguous area above 98.5 percentile of the normal reference population. The LPA parameter is the cumulative area, and the FPL is the percent capillary density loss (relative to normal mean) integrated over the LPA.
Main Outcome Measures
Peripapillary retinal LPA and FPL.
Results
Among patients with POAG, 3 had preperimetric glaucoma and 44 had perimetric glaucoma, with visual field (VF) mean deviation (MD) of −5.14±4.25 decibels (dB). The LPA was 3.40±2.29 mm2 in those with POAG and 0.11±0.18 mm2 in normal subjects (P < 0.001). The FPL was 21.8%±17.0% in those with POAG and 0.3%±0.7% in normal subjects (P < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.965 for both LPA and FPL, with a sensitivity of 93.7% at 95% specificity. The repeatability as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.977 for LPA and 0.958 for FPL. The FPL had excellent correlation with VF MD (Spearman's rho = −0.843), which was significantly (P = 0.008) better than the correlation between NFL thickness and VF MD (rho = 0.760). The hemispheric difference correlation between FPL and VF (Spearman's rho = 0.770) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than the hemispheric difference correlation between LPA and VF (rho = 0.595).
Conclusions
The low-perfusion map and LPA and FPL parameters are able to assess the location and severity of focal glaucoma damage with good agreement with VF.},

The peripapillary nerve fibre layer plexus capillary density (NFLP-CD) and macular superficial vascular complex vessel density (SVC-VD) were measured using both a commercial algorithm (AngioAnalytics) and a custom algorithm (Center for Ophthalmic Optics \&amp; Lasers Angiography Reading Toolkit (COOL-ART)). The nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell complex thicknesses were measured on structural OCT.Results The overall peripapillary NFLP-CD and macular SVC-VD measured with the two algorithms were highly correlated but poorly agreed. Among the normal controls, the perfusion measurements made by both algorithms were significantly correlated with age. AngioAnalytics measurements were also correlated with signal strength index, while COOL-ART measurements were not. These covariates were adjusted. The diagnostic accuracy, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for glaucoma detection, was not significantly different between algorithms, between structural and perfusion parameters and between the peripapillary and macular regions (All p\&gt;0.05). The macular SVC-VD in the 6 mm square had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than that of the central 3 mm square area (p=0.005).Conclusions AngioAnalytics and COOL-ART vessel density measurements are not interchangeable but potentially interconvertible. Age and signal strength are significant covariates that need to be considered. Both algorithms and both peripapillary and macular perfusion parameters have similarly good diagnostic accuracy comparable to structural OCT. A larger macular analytic area provides higher diagnostic accuracy.All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information. None.},

  abstract  = {We investigated the time and location of retinal perfusion recovery after surgical intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering in glaucoma by using optical coherent tomography angiography (OCTA). Seventeen patients were analyzed. The 4.5 × 4.5-mm OCTA scans centered on the disc were performed preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness, NFL plexus capillary density (NFLP-CD) and visual field (VF) were measured overall and in 8 corresponding sectors. The low-perfusion area (LPA) was used to assess the cumulative area where local NFLP-CD was significantly below normal. At 6 months, the average IOP decreased 5.3 mmHg (P = 0.004), LPA decreased by 15% (P = 0.005), and NFLP-CD improved by 12% (P < 0.001). The NFL thickness and VF mean deviation didn{\textquoteright}t change significantly at any time point. Among the sectors with significant preoperative NFLP-CD loss, the recovery at 6 months was greatest in sectors with minimal preoperative NFL thinning (P < 0.001). In conclusion, surgical IOP lowering may improve NFLP capillary perfusion after 6 months. The perfusion recovery tended to occur in areas with minimal NFL thinning at baseline. OCTA parameters may have potential usefulness as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for glaucoma therapy.},

We trained the algorithm on 978 volumetric OCTA scans from all participants using 5-fold cross-validation. The algorithm can distinguish NPA from shadow artifacts. The F1 score evaluated segmentation accuracy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity with specificity fixed at 95% quantified network performance to distinguish patients with diabetes from healthy control participants, referable DR from nonreferable DR (nonproliferative DR [NPDR] less than moderate severity), and severe DR (severe NPDR, proliferative DR, or DR with edema) from nonsevere DR (mild to moderate NPDR).
              Main Outcome Measures
              Widefield OCTA NPA, visual acuity (VA), and DR severities.
              Results
              Automatically segmented NPA showed high agreement with the manually delineated ground truth, with a mean ± standard deviation F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.05 in nasal, 0.82 ± 0.07 in macular, and 0.78 ± 0.05 in temporal scans. The extrafoveal avascular area (EAA) in the macular scan showed the best sensitivity at 54% for differentiating those with diabetes from healthy control participants, whereas montaged widefield OCTA scan showed significantly higher sensitivity than macular scans (P < 0.0001, McNemar’s test) for detecting eyes with DR at 66%, referable DR at 63%, and severe DR at 62%. Montaged widefield OCTA showed the highest correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.74; P < 0.0001) between EAA and DR severity. The macular scan showed the strongest negative correlation (Pearson ρ = –0.42; P < 0.0001) between EAA and best-corrected VA.
              Conclusions
              A deep learning-based algorithm for montaged widefield OCTA can detect NPA accurately and can improve the detection of clinically important DR.},

  abstract = {{Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the predominant cause of visual impairment in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Automated fluid volume measurements using optical coherence tomography (OCT) may improve the diagnostic accuracy of DME screening.To assess the diagnostic accuracy of an automated central macular fluid volume (CMFV) quantification using OCT for DME.A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary academic center among 215 patients with diabetes (1 eye each) enrolled from January 26, 2015, to December 23, 2019. All participants underwent comprehensive examinations, 6 × 6-mm macular structural OCT horizontal raster scans, and 6 × 6-mm macular OCT angiography volumetric scans. From January 1 to March 30, 2020, 2 retinal specialists reviewed the structural OCT scans independently and diagnosed DME if intraretinal or subretinal fluid was present. Diabetic macular edema was considered center involved if fluid was present within the central fovea (central 1-mm circle). A third retinal specialist arbitrated any discrepancy. The mean central subfield thickness (CST) within the central fovea was measured on structural OCT horizontal raster scans. A deep learning algorithm automatically quantified fluid volumes on 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography volumetric scans and within the central foveas (CMFV).The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the sensitivity and specificity of CST and CMFV for DME diagnosis.We enrolled 1 eye each of 215 patients with diabetes (117 women [54.4\\%]; mean [SD] age, 59.6 [12.4] years). Diabetic macular edema was present in 136 eyes; 93 cases of DME were center involved. The AUROC of CMFV for diagnosis of center-involved DME (0.907 [95\\% CI, 0.861-0.954]) was greater than the AUROC of CST (0.832 [95\\% CI, 0.775-0.889]; P = .02). With the specificity set at 95\\%, the sensitivity of CMFV for detection of center-involved DME (78.5\\% [95\\% CI, 68.8\\%-86.3\\%]) was higher than that of CST (53.8\\% [95\\% CI, 43.1\\%-64.2\\%]; P = .002). Center-involved DME cases not detected by CST but detected by CMFV were associated with a thinner CST (290.8 μm [95\\% CI, 282.3-299.3 μm] vs 369.4 μm [95\\% CI, 347.1-391.7 μm]; P \\&lt; .001), higher proportion of previous macular laser treatment (11 of 28 [39.3\\%; 95\\% CI, 21.5\\%-59.4\\%] vs 12 of 65 [18.5\\%; 95\\% CI, 9.9\\%-30.0\\%]; P = .03), and female sex (20 of 28 [71.4\\%; 95\\% CI, 51.3\\%-86.8\\%] vs 31 of 65 [47.7\\%; 95\\% CI, 35.1\\%-60.5\\%]; P = .04).These findings suggest that an automated CMFV is a more accurate diagnostic biomarker than CST for DME and may improve screening for DME.}},

  abstract = {{   The purpose of this study was to assess the associations between baseline choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits and geographic atrophy (GA) progression.    In this prospective cohort study, patients with GA underwent 3 × 3-mm macular spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) at baseline and follow-up visits. Annual GA enlargement rate was defined as change of square root of GA area in 12 months. Shadow areas due to iris, media opacity, retinal vessels, and drusen were excluded. CC vessel density (CC-VD) in non-GA areas was measured using a validated machine-learning-based algorithm. Low perfusion area (LPA) was defined as capillary density below the 0.1 percentile threshold of the same location of 40 normal healthy control eye. Focal perfusion loss (FPL) was defined as percentage of CC loss within LPA compared with normal controls.    Ten patients with GA were enrolled and followed for 26 months on average. At baseline, the mean GA area was 0.84 ± 0.70 mm2. The mean CC-VD was 44.5 ± 15.2\\%, the mean LPA was 4.29 ± 2.6 mm2, and the mean FPL was 50.4 ± 28.2\\%. The annual GA enlargement rate was significantly associated with baseline CC-VD (r = −0.816, P = 0.004), LPA (r = 0.809, P = 0.005), and FPL (r = 0.800, P = 0.005), but not with age (r = 0.008, P = 0.98) and GA area (r = −0.362, P = 0.30).    Baseline CC flow deficits were significantly associated with a faster GA enlargement over the course of 1 year, suggesting the choriocapillaris perfusion outside of a GA area may play a role in GA progression.  }},

With numerous studies demonstrating unique capabilities in biomarker quantification, diagnosis, and monitoring, OCTA technology has seen rapid adoption in research and clinical settings. The value of OCTA imaging is significantly enhanced by image analysis tools that provide rapid and accurate quantification of vascular features and pathology. Today, the most powerful image analysis methods are based on artificial intelligence (AI). While AI encompasses a large variety of techniques, machine-learning-based, and especially deep-learning-based, image analysis provides accurate measurements in a variety of contexts, including different diseases and regions of the eye. Here, we discuss the principles of both OCTA and AI that make their combination capable of answering new questions. We also review contemporary applications of AI in OCTA, which include accurate detection of pathologies such as choroidal neovascularization, precise quantification of retinal perfusion, and reliable disease diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              To evaluate the performance of a federated learning framework for deep neural network-based retinal microvasculature segmentation and referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) classification using OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA).
              Design
              Retrospective analysis of clinical OCT and OCTA scans of control participants and patients with diabetes.
              Participants
              The 153 OCTA en face images used for microvasculature segmentation were acquired from 4 OCT instruments with fields of view ranging from 2 × 2-mm to 6 × 6-mm. The 700 eyes used for RDR classification consisted of OCTA en face images and structural OCT projections acquired from 2 commercial OCT systems.
              Methods
              OCT angiography images used for microvasculature segmentation were delineated manually and verified by retina experts. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was evaluated by retinal specialists and was condensed into 2 classes: non-RDR and RDR. The federated learning configuration was demonstrated via simulation using 4 clients for microvasculature segmentation and was compared with other collaborative training methods. Subsequently, federated learning was applied over multiple institutions for RDR classification and was compared with models trained and tested on data from the same institution (internal models) and different institutions (external models).
              Main Outcome Measures
              For microvasculature segmentation, we measured the accuracy and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). For severity classification, we measured accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve, balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity.
              Results
              For both applications, federated learning achieved similar performance as internal models. Specifically, for microvasculature segmentation, the federated learning model achieved similar performance (mean DSC across all test sets, 0.793) as models trained on a fully centralized dataset (mean DSC, 0.807). For RDR classification, federated learning achieved a mean AUROC of 0.954 and 0.960; the internal models attained a mean AUROC of 0.956 and 0.973. Similar results are reflected in the other calculated evaluation metrics.
              Conclusions
              Federated learning showed similar results to traditional deep learning in both applications of segmentation and classification, while maintaining data privacy. Evaluation metrics highlight the potential of collaborative learning for increasing domain diversity and the generalizability of models used for the classification of OCT data.},

Portable handheld OCT/OCTA systems are required for imaging patients in the supine position. Examples include infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and operating room (OR). The speed of image acquisition plays a pivotal role in acquiring high-quality OCT/OCTA images, particularly with the handheld system, since both the operator hand tremor and subject motion can cause significant motion artifacts. In addition, having a large field of view and the ability of real-time data visualization are critical elements in rapid disease screening, reducing imaging time, and detecting peripheral retinal pathologies. The arrangement of optical components is less flexible in the handheld system due to the limitation of size and weight. In this paper, we introduce a 400-kHz, 55-degree field of view handheld OCT/OCTA system that has overcome many technical challenges as a portable OCT system as well as a high-speed OCTA system. We demonstrate imaging premature infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in the NICU, a patient with incontinentia pigmenti (IP), and a patient with X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) in the OR using our handheld OCT system. Our design may have the potential for improving the diagnosis of retinal diseases and help provide a practical guideline for designing a flexible and portable OCT system.},

Participants were imaged with 4.5 × 4.5 mm volumetric disc scans using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The normalized NFL reflectance map was processed by an azimuthal filter to reduce directional reflectance bias caused by variation of beam incidence angle. The peripapillary area of the map was divided into 160 superpixels. Average reflectance was the mean of superpixel reflectance. Low-reflectance superpixels were identified as those with NFL reflectance below the fifth percentile normative cutoff. Focal reflectance loss was measured by summing loss in low-reflectance superpixels.    Thirty-five normal, 30 preperimetric, and 35 perimetric glaucoma participants were enrolled. Azimuthal filtering improved the repeatability of the normalized NFL reflectance, as measured by the pooled superpixel standard deviation (SD), from 0.73 to 0.57 dB (P \\&lt; 0.001, paired t-test) and reduced the population SD from 2.14 to 1.78 dB (P \\&lt; 0.001, t-test).

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Accumulated vascular damage contributes to the onset and progression of vascular dementia and possibly to Alzheimer's disease. Here we evaluate the feasibility and utility of using retinal imaging of microvascular markers to identify older adults at risk of cognitive disease. Methods The “Eye Determinants of Cognition” (EyeDOC) study recruited a biracial, population-based sample of participants from two sites: Jackson, MS, and Washington Co, MD. Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) was used to capture vessel density (VD) from a 6 × 6 mm scan of the macula in several vascular layers from 2017 to 2019. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area was also estimated. Image quality was assessed by trained graders at a reading center. A neurocognitive battery of 10 tests was administered at three time points from 2011 to 2019 and incident mild cognitive impairement (MCI)/dementia cases were ascertained. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate associations of retinal vascular markers with cognitive factor score change over time. Results Nine-hundred and seventy-six older adults (mean age of 78.7 (± 4.4) years, 44\% black) were imaged. Gradable images were obtained in 55\% (535/976), with low signal strength (66\%) and motion artifact (22\%) being the largest contributors to poor quality. Among the 297 participants with both high-quality images and no clinically significant retinal pathology, the average decline in global cognitive function factor score was −0.03 standard deviations per year. In adjusted analyses, no associations of VD or FAZ with longitudinal changes in either global cognitive function or with incident MCI/dementia were found. Conclusions In this large biracial community sample of older adults representative of the target population for retinal screening of cognitive risk, we found that obtaining high-quality OCTA scans was infeasible in a nearly half of older adults. Among the select sample of healthier older adults with scans, OCTA markers were not predictive of cognitive impairment.},

The number of times the spectrum was split and the bandwidth of each split were adjusted to maximize the flow phantom decorrelation signal-to-noise ratio. The improvement in flow detection was then demonstrated with en face retinal angiograms. The optimized algorithm increased the detectable retinal microvascular flow and decreased the variability of the quantified vessel density in OCT retinal angiograms of healthy human subjects.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: To use projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography (PR-OCTA) to characterize the microvascular changes in 3 distinct retinal plexuses in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Methods: A commercial 70-kHz spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was used to acquire 6-mm macular scans from RP patients and age-matched healthy participants at a tertiary academic center. Blood flow was detected using a commercial version of split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm. The PR-OCTA algorithm was used to suppress projection artifacts and resolve microvasculature in 3 plexuses around the macula. Vessel density was calculated from en face OCTA of the parafoveal and perifoveal regions in each of the 3 plexuses, as well as the all-plexus inner retinal slab. Inner and outer retinal thicknesses were measured form structural OCT scans. Generalized estimating equations and Spearman's rank correlation statistical methods were used. Results: Forty-four eyes from 26 RP patients and 34 eyes from 26 healthy subjects were included. Significant reduction in vessel density was detected in the perifovea but not the parafovea of inner retinal slab of RP patients (P = .001 and P = .56, respectively) compared to controls. We also found deeper retinal plexuses (intermediate and deep capillary plexuses, ICP and DCP) were primarily damaged by RP, compared to superficial vascular complex (SVC). Significant thickening of the inner retina and thinning of the outer retina were also observed. Strong correlation was found between the vessel density in the perifoveal ICP and DCP and outer retinal thickness in RP patients with no history of cystoid macular edema. Conclusions: PR-OCTA enables the detection of microvascular changes in the perifoveal regions of the ICP and DCP in RP, with relative sparing of the SVC. OCT and OCTA parameters might be able to provide better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as monitoring disease progression and the response to experimental treatments.},

One proposed method achieved this by introducing a wavenumber shift (k-shift) in the interferograms of interest and searching for the k-shift that minimized the fixed-pattern noise amplitude. The other method calculated the relative k-shift using the phase information at the residual fixed-pattern noise location. Repeating this wavenumber alignment procedure for all A-lines of interest produced fixed-pattern noise free and phase stable OCT images. A system incorporating these correction routines was used for human retina OCT and Doppler OCT imaging. The results from the two methods were compared, and it was found that the intensity-based method provided better results.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: Use projection-resolved OCT angiography to investigate the autoregulatory response in the 3 parafoveal retinal plexuses under hyperoxia. Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants: Nine eyes from 9 healthy participants. Methods: One eye from each participant was scanned using a commercial spectral-domain OCT system. Two repeated macular scans (3 × 3 mm2) were acquired at baseline and during oxygen breathing. The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation algorithm was used to detect blood flow. The projection-resolved algorithm was used to suppress projection artifacts and resolve blood flow in 3 distinct parafoveal plexuses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare baseline and hyperoxic parameters. The coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and pooled standard deviation were used to assess the reliability of OCT angiography measurements. Main Outcome Measures: Flow index and vessel density were calculated from the en face angiograms of each of the 3 plexuses, as well as from the all-plexus inner retinal slab. Results: Hyperoxia induced significant reduction in the flow index (−11%) and vessel density (−7.8%) of only the deep capillary plexus (P < 0.001) and in the flow index of the all-plexus slab (P = 0.015). The flow index also decreased in the intermediate capillary plexus and the superficial vascular complex, but these changes were small and not statistically significant. The projection-resolved OCT angiography showed good within-session baseline repeatability (coefficient of variation, 0.8%–5.2%; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.93–0.98) in all parameters. Relatively large between-day response reproducibility was observed (pooled standard deviation, 1.7%–9.4%). Conclusions: Projection-resolved OCT angiography was able to show that the retinal autoregulatory response to hyperoxia affects only the deep capillary plexus, but not the intermediate capillary plexus or superficial vascular complex.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To detect plexus-specific peripapillary retinal perfusion defects in glaucoma, using projection-resolved optical coherence tomography angiography (PR-OCTA). Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Methods: One eye each of 45 perimetric glaucoma participants and 37 age-matched normal participants were scanned using 4.5-mm OCTA scans centered on the disc. The PR-OCTA algorithm removed flow projection artifacts in OCT angiograms. Five en face OCTA slabs were analyzed: nerve fiber layer plexus (NFLP), ganglion cell layer plexus (GCLP), superficial vascular complex (SVC [NFLP + GCLP]), deep vascular complex (DVC), and all plexi combined. Peripapillary retinal capillary density (CD) and vessel density (VD) were calculated using a reflectance-compensated algorithm. Results: Focal capillary dropout could be visualized more clearly in the NFLP than in the other slabs. The NFLP, SVC, and all-plexus CD in the glaucoma group were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in the normal group, but no significant differences in GCLP-CD and DVC-CD appeared between the 2 groups. Both NFLP-CD and SVC-CD had excellent diagnostic accuracy, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC = 0.981 and 0.976), correlation with visual field mean deviation (Pearson r = 0.819 and 0.831), and repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.947 and 0.942). Performances of NFLP-VD and SVC-VD were similar to the corresponding CD parameters. Conclusions: In this glaucoma group, reduction in perfusion was more pronounced in superficial layers of the peripapillary retina (NFLP and SVC) than in the deeper layers. Reflectance-compensated CD and VD parameters for both NFLP and SVC could be useful in the clinical management of glaucoma.},

In this algorithm, OCTA B-frames were divided into segments within which the bulk motion velocity could be assumed to be constant. This velocity was recovered using linear regression of decorrelation versus the logarithm of reflectance in axial lines (A-lines) identified as bulk tissue by percentile analysis. The fitting parameters were used to calculate a reflectance-adjusted upper bound threshold for bulk motion decorrelation. Below this threshold, voxels are identified as non-flow tissue, their flow values are set to zeros. Above this threshold, the voxels are identified as flow voxels and bulk motion velocity is subtracted from each using a nonlinear decorrelation-velocity relationship previously established in laboratory flow phantoms. Compared to the simpler median-subtraction method, the regression-based bulk motion subtraction improved angiogram signal-to-noise ratio, contrast, vessel density repeatability, and bulk motion noise cleanup in the foveal avascular zone, while preserving the connectivity of the vascular networks in the angiogram.},

Diabetic retinopathy is a pathology where microvascular circulation abnormalities ultimately result in photoreceptor disruption and, consequently, permanent loss of vision. Here, we developed a method that automatically detects photoreceptor disruption in mild diabetic retinopathy by mapping ellipsoid zone reflectance abnormalities from en face optical coherence tomography images. The algorithm uses a fuzzy c-means scheme with a redefined membership function to assign a defect severity level on each pixel and generate a probability map of defect category affiliation. A novel scheme of unsupervised clustering optimization allows accurate detection of the affected area. The achieved accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were about 90% on a population of thirteen diseased subjects. This method shows potential for accurate and fast detection of early biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy evolution.},

  abstract = {Retinal vascular diseases are important causes of vision loss. A detailed evaluation of the vascular abnormalities facilitates diagno-sis and treatment in these diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography using the highly efficient split-spectrum ampli-tude decorrelation angiography algorithm offers an alternative to conventional dye-based retinal angiography. OCT angiography has several advantages, including 3D visualization of retinal and cho-roidal circulations (including the choriocapillaris) and avoidance of dye injection-related complications. Results from six illustrative cases are reported. In diabetic retinopathy, OCT angiography can detect neovascularization and quantify ischemia. In age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization can be ob-served without the obscuration of details caused by dye leakage in conventional angiography. Choriocapillaris dysfunction can be detected in the nonneovascular form of the disease, furthering our understanding of pathogenesis. In choroideremia, OCT's ability to show choroidal and retinal vascular dysfunction separately may be valuable in predicting progression and assessing treatment re-sponse. OCT angiography shows promise as a noninvasive alter-native to dye-based angiography for highly detailed, in vivo, 3D, quantitative evaluation of retinal vascular abnormalities. optical coherence tomography angiography | ophthalmic imaging | ocular circulation O ptical coherence tomography (OCT) has become the most commonly used imaging modality in ophthalmology. It pro-vides cross-sectional and 3D imaging of the retina and optic nerve head with micrometer-scale depth resolution. Structural OCT enhances the clinician's ability to detect and monitor fluid exudation associated with retinal vascular diseases. Whereas anatomical alterations that impact vision are readily visible, structural OCT has a limited ability to image the retinal or choroidal vasculatures. Furthermore, it is unable to directly de-tect capillary dropout or pathologic new vessel growth (neo-vascularization) that are the major vascular changes associated with two of the leading causes of blindness, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (1). To visualize these changes, traditional i.v. contrast dye-based angiography techniques are currently used. Fluorescein dye is primarily used to visualize the retinal vas-culature. A separate dye, indocyanine green (ICG), is necessary to evaluate the choroidal vasculature. Both fluorescein angiog-raphy (FA) and ICG angiography require i.v. injection, which is time consuming, and which can cause nausea, vomiting, and, rarely, anaphylaxis (2). Dye leakage or staining provides infor-mation regarding vascular incompetence (e.g., from abnormal capillary growth), but it also obscures the image and blurs the boundaries of neovascularization. Additionally, conventional an-giography is 2D, which makes it difficult to distinguish vascular abnormalities within different layers. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a no-injection, dye-free method for 3D visualization of ocular circulation. In recent years, several OCT angiography methods have been developed to detect changes in the OCT signal caused by flowing red blood cells in blood vessels. Initially, Doppler OCT angiog-raphy methods were investigated for the visualization and mea-surement of blood flow (3–8). Because Doppler OCT is only sensitive to motion parallel to the OCT probe beam, it is limited in its ability to image retinal and choroidal circulations, which are predominantly perpendicular to the OCT beam. More recent approaches, based on detecting variation in the speckle pattern over time, are sensitive to both transverse and axial flow. Several types of speckle-based techniques have been described, including amplitude-based (9–11), phase-based (12), or a combination of both amplitude and phase (13) variance methods. We developed an amplitude-based method called split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA). The SSADA al-gorithm detects motion in the blood vessel lumen by measuring the variation in reflected OCT signal amplitude between consecutive cross-sectional scans. The novelty of SSADA lies in how the OCT},

  abstract = {Aim To assess total retinal blood flow (TRBF) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) using multiplane en face Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods A 70 kHz spectral-domain OCT system scanned a 2×2 mm area centred at the optic disc of the eyes with DR and healthy participants. The multiplane en face Doppler OCT algorithm generated a three-dimensional volumetric data set consisting of 195 en face planes. The TRBF was calculated from the maximum flow values of each branching retinal vein at an optimised en face plane. DR severity was graded according to the international clinical classification system. The generalised linear model method was used to compare flow values between DR groups and the control group. Results A total of 71 eyes from 71 participants were included. Ten eyes were excluded due to poor image quality. The within-visit repeatability of scans was 4.1 (coefficient of variation). There was no significant difference in the TRBF between the healthy (46.7±10.2 $\mu$L/min) and mild/moderate non-proliferative DR (44.9±12.6 $\mu$L/min) groups. The TRBF in severe non-proliferative DR (39.1±12.6 $\mu$L/min) and proliferative DR (28.9±8.85 $\mu$L/min) groups were significantly lower (p=0.04 and p<0.0001, respectively) than that of the healthy group. TRBF was correlated with DR disease severity (p<0.0001, linear trend test). Conclusion The novel multiplane en face Doppler OCT method provided reliable measurements of TRBF in DR eyes. This may be a useful tool in understanding the pathophysiology of DR.},

Results: Sixty-three study participants were followed up every 6 months and 48 completed the 2-year study. Mean age was 78 years and 60.3% were female. On the baseline visit, 5 eyes (7.9%) were found to have nonexudative CNV by OCTA, and 3 of them demonstrated exudation. Of 58 eyes with a normal OCTA on baseline visit, 5 eyes developed nonexudative CNV during a follow-up visit. All 5 of these nonexudative CNV went on to develop exudation in subsequent visits. Overall, 8 of the 10 eyes with nonexudative CNV developed exudation with a mean time of 8 months and mean CNV area growth rate of 20% per month (P = 0.014, exponential model). Initiation of antiangiogenic treatment halted their growth. In comparison, exudation occurred in only 6 of the 53 eyes (11%) that lacked a precursor nonexudative CNV. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that having nonexudative CNV detected was associated with an 18.1-fold increase in the rate of exudation subsequently developing (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Nonexudative CNV frequently is detected by OCTA in the fellow eyes of those with exudative CNV. These lesions carry a high risk of exudation developing within the first year after detection and could benefit from close monitoring. The high risk of progression may justify prophylactic treatment; further studies are needed.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Novel therapies for choroideremia, an X-linked recessive chorioretinal degeneration, demand a better understanding of the primary site(s) of cellular degeneration. Optical coherence tomography angiography allows for choriocapillaris (CC) imaging. We compared the extent of structural alterations of the CC, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors with multimodal imaging. OBSERVATIONS: In a clinical case series conducted from September 15, 2014, through February 5, 2015, 14 eyes of 7 male patients with choroideremia (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 15-46 years]; age range, 13-48 years), 4 eyes of 2 women with choroideremia carrier state (both in mid-50s), and 6 eyes of 6 controls (median age, 42.5 years [interquartile range, 33-55 years]; age range, 24-55 years) underwent multimodal imaging with optical coherence tomography angiography and electroretinography. The mean (SD) macular CC density was 82.9% (13.4%) in patients with choroideremia, 93.0% (3.8%) in female carriers, and 98.2% (1.3%) in controls. The mean (SD) CC density in affected eyes was higher in regions with preserved (92.6% [5.8%]) vs absent (75.9% [12.6%]) ellipsoid zone (mean difference, 16.7%; 95% CI, 12.1% to 21.3%; P <.001). Seventeen of 18 eyes of the patients and carriers had outer retinal tubulations forming pseudopod-like extensions from islands of preserved ellipsoid zone. Outer retinal tubulations were associated with absence of underlying retinal pigment epithelium and were longer (r = -0.62; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.19; P <.001) and more numerous (r = -0.71; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.27; P <.001) in more severely affected eyes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that regional changes in CC density correlate with photoreceptor structural alterations in choroideremia. Although closely coupled, the results suggest that retinal pigment epithelium loss is more extensive than photoreceptor loss.},

Methods: In this retrospective report, a case of exudative CNV was followed closely with OCT angiography over three cycles of antiangiogenic treatment. Outer retinal flow index, CNV flow area and central macular retinal thickness were measured. Results: Quantitative measurements of CNV flow area and flow index showed rapid shutdown of flow over the initial 2 weeks, followed by reappearance of CNV channel by the fourth week, preceding fluid reaccumulation at 6 weeks. Conclusion: Frequent OCT angiography reveals a previously unknown pattern of rapid shutdown and reappearance of CNV channels within treatment cycles. OCT angiographic changes precede fluid reaccumulation and could be useful as leading indicators of CNV activity that could guide treatment timing. Further studies using OCT angiography in short intervals between antiangiogenic treatments are needed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate wide-field optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for detection of clinically unsuspected neovascularization (NV) in diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: This prospective observational single-center study included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of nonproliferative DR. Participants underwent a clinical examination, standard 7-field color photography, and OCTA with commercial and prototype swept-source devices. The wide-field OCTA was achieved by montaging five 6 × 10-mm scans from a prototype device into a 25 × 10-mm image and three 6 × 6-mm scans from a commercial device into a 15 × 6-mm image. A masked grader determined the retinopathy severity from color photographs. Two trained readers examined conventional and wide-field OCTA images for the presence of NV. RESULTS: Of 27 participants, photographic grading found 13 mild, 7 moderate, and 7 severe nonproliferative DR. Conventional 6 × 6-mm OCTA detected NV in 2 eyes (7%) and none with 3 × 3-mm scans. Both prototype and commercial wide-field OCTA detected NV in two additional eyes. The mean area of NV was 0.38 mm (range 0.17-0.54 mm). All eyes with OCTA-detected NV were photographically graded as severe nonproliferative DR. CONCLUSION: Wide-field OCTA can detect small NV not seen on clinical examination or color photographs and may improve the clinical evaluation of DR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To evaluate if projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography (PR-OCTA) reduces projection artifact with less attenuation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) flow signal compared to conventional OCTA with slab subtraction. METHODS. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, participants with subfoveal treatment-na{\"{i}}ve CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration underwent OCTA. Scans were exported for custom processing including manual segmentation as necessary, application of slab subtraction and PR-OCTA algorithm, and calculation of CNV vascular area and connectivity. CNV was classified as type 1, minimally type 2, or predominantly type 2 based on fluorescein angiography (FA) and OCT. Two masked retina specialists independently classified CNV using cross-sectional conventional OCTA and PR-OCTA. RESULTS. A total of 17 eyes were enrolled in this study. Mean CNV vessel area (mm 2 ) was 0.67 ± 0.51 for PR-OCTA and 0.53 ± 0.41 for slab subtraction (P = 0.018). Mean vascular connectivity was 96.80 ± 1.28 for PR-OCTA and 90.90 ± 4.42 (P = 0.018) for slab subtraction. Within-visit repeatability (coefficient of variation) of PR-OCTA was 0.044 for CNV vessel area and 0.012 for vascular connectivity, compared to 0.093 and 0.028 by slab subtraction. PR-OCTA classification agreement with FA/OCT was 88.2% and 76.5% for the two graders, while conventional OCTA agreement was 58.8% and 70.6% (grader 1, P = 0.025; grader 2, P = 0.56). Moreover, PR-OCTA enabled the individual quantification of type 1 and type 2 components of a CNV. CONCLUSIONS. PR-OCTA had greater CNV vessel area and vascular connectivity, as well as better repeatability, compared to slab subtraction, suggesting PR-OCTA is a superior technique for imaging CNV. Furthermore, PR-OCTA removes projection artifact on cross-sectional OCTA, improving the ability to classify and quantify CNV components.},

Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: We recruited patients with diabetes from a tertiary academic retina practice and obtained 3-mm × 3-mm macular OCTA scans with the AngioVue system and standard 7-field color photographs at baseline and at a 1-year follow-up visit. A masked grader determined the severity of DR from the color photographs using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy scale. A custom algorithm detected extrafoveal AA (EAA) excluding the central 1-mm circle in projection-resolved superficial vascular complex (SVC), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP). Results: Of 138 patients, 92 (41 men, ranging in age from 26-84 years [mean 59.4 years]) completed 1 year of follow-up. At baseline, EAAs for SVC, ICP, and DCP were all significantly correlated with retinopathy severity (P < .0001). DCP EAA was significantly associated with worse visual acuity (r = −0.24, P = .02), but SVC and ICP EAA were not. At 1 year, 11 eyes progressed in severity by at least 1 step. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the progression was significantly associated with baseline SVC EAA (odds ratio = 8.73, P = .04). During the follow-up period, 33 eyes underwent treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment requirement was significantly associated with baseline DCP EAA (odds ratio = 3.39, P = .002). No baseline metric was associated with vision loss at 1 year. Conclusions: EAAs detected by OCTA in diabetic eyes are significantly associated with baseline DR severity, disease progression, and treatment requirement over 1 year.},

  abstract = {Aims: To investigate swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography in the optic nerve head (ONH) and parafoveal regions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
              Methods: Fifty-two MS eyes and 21 healthy control (HC) eyes were included. There were two MS subgroups: 38 MS eyes without an optic neuritis (ON) history (MS -ON), and 14 MS eyes with an ON history (MS +ON). The OCT images were captured by high-speed 1050 nm swept-source OCT. The ONH flow index (FI) and parafoveal FI were quantified from OCT angiograms.
              Results: The mean ONH FI was 0.160±0.010 for the HC group, 0.156±0.017 for the MS-ON group, and 0.140±0.020 for the MS+ON group. The ONH FI of the MS+ON group was reduced by 12.5% compared to HC eyes (p=0.004). A higher percentage of MS+ON eyes had abnormal ONH FI compared to HC patients (43% vs 5%, p=0.01). Mean parafoveal FIs were 0.126±0.007, 0.127±0.010, and 0.129±0.005 for the HC, MS-ON, and MS +ON groups, respectively, and did not differ significantly among them. The coefficient of variation (CV) of intravisit repeatability and intervisit reproducibility were 1.03% and 4.53% for ONH FI, and 1.65% and 3.55% for parafoveal FI.
              Conclusions: Based on OCT angiography, the FI measurement is feasible, highly repeatable and reproducible, and it is suitable for clinical measurement of ONH and parafoveal perfusion. The ONH FI may be useful in detecting damage from ON and quantifying its severity.},

  abstract = {Importance Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss that is managed primarily through qualitative clinical examination of the retina. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) may offer an objective and quantitative method of evaluating DR. Objective To quantify capillary nonperfusion in 3 vascular plexuses in the macula of eyes patients with diabetes of various retinopathy severity using projection-resolved OCTA (PR-OCTA). Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study at a tertiary academic center comprising 1 eye each from healthy control individuals and patients with diabetes at different severity stages of retinopathy. Data were acquired and analyzed between January 2015 and December 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Foveal avascular zone area, extrafoveal avascular area (EAA), and the sensitivity of detecting levels of retinopathy. Results The study included 39 control individuals (20 women [51%]; mean [SD] age, 43.41 [19.37] years); 16 patients with diabetes without retinopathy (8 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 56.50 [12.43] years); 23 patients with mild to moderate nonproliferative DR (18 women [78%] ; mean [SD] age, 62.48 [10.55] years); and 32 patients with severe nonproliferative DR or proliferative DR (12 women [38%]; mean age, 53.41 [14.05] years). Mean (SD) foveal avascular zone area was 0.203 (0.103) mm2for control individuals, 0.192 (0.084) mm2for patients with diabetes without retinopathy, 0.243 [0.079] mm2for mild to moderate nonproliferative DR, and 0.359 (0.275) mm2for severe nonproliferative DR or proliferative DR. Mean (SD) EAA in whole inner retinal slab in these groups, respectively, were 0.020 (0.031) mm2, 0.034 (0.047) mm2, 0.038 (0.040) mm2, and 0.237 (0.235) mm2. The mean (SD) sum of EAA from 3 segmented plexuses in each of the respective groups were 0.103 (0.169) mm2, 0.213 (0.242) mm2, 0.451 (0.243) mm2, and 1.325 (1.140) mm2. With specificity fixed at 95%, using EAA in inner retinal slab, the sensitivity of detecting patients with diabetes from healthy control individuals was 28% (95% CI, 18%-40%), 31% for patients with DR (95% CI, 19%-45%), and 47% for patients with severe DR (95% CI, 29%-65%) from whole inner retinal EAA. With the sum of EAA from 3 individual plexuses, the sensitivities were 69% (95% CI, 57%-80%), 82% (95% CI, 70%-91%), and 97% (95% CI, 85%-100%), respectively. Avascular areas were not associated with signal strength index. The commercial vessel density from the 2-plexus scheme distinguished the groups with lower sensitivity and were dependent on SSI. Conclusions and Relevance Automatically quantified avascular areas from a 3-layer segmentation scheme using PR-OCTA distinguished levels of retinopathy with a greater sensitivity than avascular areas from unsegmented inner retinal slab or measurements from a commercially available vessel density in 2-layer scheme. Additional studies are needed to investigate the applicability of nonperfusion parameters in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Detecting and quantifying the size of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is important for the diagnosis and assessment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Depth-resolved imaging of the retinal and choroidal vasculature by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has enabled the visualization of CNV. However, due to the prevalence of artifacts, it is difficult to segment and quantify the CNV lesion area automatically. We have previously described a saliency algorithm for CNV detection that could identify a CNV lesion area with 83% accuracy. However, this method works under the assumption that the CNV region is the most salient area for visual attention in the whole image and consequently, errors occur when this requirement is not met (e.g. when the lesion occupies a large portion of the image). Moreover, saliency image processing methods cannot extract the edges of the salient object very accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel and automatic CNV segmentation method based on an unsupervised and parallel machine learning technique named density cell-like P systems (DEC P systems). DEC P systems integrate the idea of a modified clustering algorithm into cell-like P systems. This method improved the accuracy of detection to 87.2% on 22 subjects and obtained clear boundaries of the CNV lesions.},

  abstract = {Retinal blood supply is tightly regulated under a variety of hemodynamic considerations in order to satisfy a high metabolic need and maintain both vessel structure and function. Simulation of the human eye can induce hemodynamics alterations, and attempt to assess the vascular reactivity response has been well documented in the scientific literature. Advancements in noninvasive imaging technologies have led to the characterization of magnitude and time course in retinal blood flow response to stimuli. This allowed for a better understanding of the mechanism in which blood flow is regulated, as well as identifying functional impairments in the diseased eye. Clinically, the ability to detect retinal blood flow reactivity during stimulation of the eye offers potential for the detection, differentiation, and diagnosis of diseases.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: To use OCT angiography (OCTA)-derived quantitative metrics to assess the response of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to pro re nata (PRN) anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: Fourteen eyes from 14 study participants with treatment-na{\"{i}}ve neovascular AMD were enrolled. Methods: Participants were evaluated monthly and treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents under a PRN protocol for 1 year. At each visit, two 3 × 3-mm2 OCTA scans were obtained. Custom image processing was applied to segment the outer retinal slab, suppress projection artifact, and automatically detect CNV. Choroidal neovascularization membrane area and CNV vessel area were calculated. Main Outcome Measures: Individual and mean CNV membrane area and CNV vessel area at each visit; within-visit repeatability determined by coefficient of variation. Results: Eight eyes showed the entire CNV to be within the 3 × 3-mm2 scanning area and had adequate image quality for CNV quantification. One patient (patient 2) was excluded from analysis because of the presence of a large subretinal hemorrhage overlying the CNV membrane. In the remaining patients, CNV vessel area was reduced by 39%, 50%, 43%, and 41% at months 1, 3, 6, and 12, respectively. Choroidal neovascularization membrane area was reduced by 39%, 51%, 54%, and 45% at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. At month 6, mean change from baseline was not statistically significant for CNV vessel area, whereas it was statistically significant for CNV membrane area. Neither metric was significantly different compared with baseline at month 12. Individual analyses revealed each CNV had a unique response under PRN treatment. Within-visit repeatability was 7.96% (coefficient of variation) for CNV vessel area and 7.37% for CNV membrane area. Conclusions: In this small exploratory study of CNV response to PRN anti-VEGF treatment, both CNV vessel area and membrane area were reduced compared with baseline after 3 months. After 1 year of follow-up, these reductions were no longer statistically significant. When anti-VEGF treatment was withheld, increasing CNV vessel area over time often resulted in exudation, but it was not possible to determine exactly when exudation occurs.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: To study longitudinal changes in retinal capillary circulation in eyes treated with iodine 125 (I125) plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma using OCT angiography (OCTA). Design: Longitudinal prospective study of 21 patients undergoing treatment for uveal melanoma with I125 plaque brachytherapy. Eyes with melanoma were imaged with OCTA before treatment and at 12-month intervals until 2 years after brachytherapy. Participants: After institutional review board approval, participants were enrolled prospectively from an academic ocular oncology clinic. Methods: Peripapillary (4.5 × 4.5-mm) and macular (3 × 3-mm) OCTA scans were acquired with AngioVue (Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA). Main Outcome Measures: The peripapillary nerve fiber layer plexus capillary density (NFLP_CD), macular superficial vascular complex vessel density (mSVC_VD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were calculated. Results: Before treatment, no significant difference was found in the NFLP_CD, mSVC_VD, or FAZ area between eyes with melanoma and normal fellow eyes. By 24 months, 11 eyes had developed clinical signs of radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy, or both. In treated eyes, the NFLP_CD (48.4±4.1%) was reduced at 12 months (46.7±5.0%; P = 0.04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 24 months (44.5±6.1%; P < 0.001). Similarly, the mSVC_VD (48.4 2±3.6%) was reduced in treated eyes at 12 months (43.5±5.9%; P = 0.01) and 24 months (37.4±9.1%; P < 0.001). The FAZ area (0.26±0.11 mm2) increased in treated eyes at 12 months (0.35±0.22 mm2; P = 0.009) and 24 months (0.81±1.03 mm2; P = 0.001). When only eyes with clinically evident radiation changes were evaluated, the changes in NFLP_CD, mSVC_VD, and FAZ area were more pronounced. OCT angiography measurements correlated with both radiation dose and visual acuity. The mSVC_VD measured at 12 months was found to predict the development of clinically apparent radiation retinopathy within 1 year. Conclusions: OCT angiography demonstrated early emergence of peripapillary and macular capillary vasculature changes after I125 plaque brachytherapy. OCT angiography provided a quantitative measurement of retinal capillary changes associated with ischemia that correlated with visual acuity and radiation dose and may predict future development of radiation-induced retinal toxicity.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has improved the care of adults with vitreoretinal disease, and OCT angiography (OCTA) is demonstrating promise as a technique to visualize the retinal vasculature with lower risk and cost than fluorescein angiography. However, to date, there are no commercially available devices able to obtain ultra-wide-field OCT or OCTA images in neonates. OBJECTIVE: To obtain ultra-wide-field OCT and OCTA images in neonates with ROP using a prototype handheld OCT and OCTA device. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational case series was conducted from March 1 to April 1, 2017, in an academic medical center among 4 neonates with ROP in the neonatal intensive care unit and in the operating room. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Acquisition of wide-field OCT and OCTA images using a handheld prototype OCTA and ultra-wide-field OCT device. RESULTS: Images were obtained from 4 neonates (1 girl and 3 boys; mean age, 38 weeks' postmenstrual age [range, 34-43 weeks]) with various stages of ROP: 3 in the neonatal intensive care unit and 1 in the operating room. The system can obtain noncontact en face OCT images and horizontal line scans with an approximately 40° field of view and up to 100° (ultra-wide-field) using a contact lens-based approach in a single 2-second scan. In addition, 20° × 20° (approximately 4 × 4-mm) OCTA scans were obtained in patients with ROP in a single 2-second scan. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Optical coherence tomography and OCTA are gaining popularity in pediatric retinal imaging. This study reports on OCTA and ultra-wide-field OCT images in 4 neonates with various stages of ROP that were obtained using a prototype handheld device. Additional studies will be needed to prove the clinical value of this technology.},

  abstract = {Purpose. To measure the change in peripapillary retinal blood flow in response to hyperoxia by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Methods. One eye of each healthy human participants (six) was scanned with a commercial high-speed (70 kHz) spectral OCT. Scans were captured twice after 10-minute exposures to normal breathing (baseline) and hyperoxia. Blood flow was detected by the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm. Peripapillary retinal blood flow index and vessel density were calculated from en face maximum projections of the retinal layers. The experiment was performed on 2 separate days for each participant. Coefficient of variation (CV) was used to measure within-day repeatability and between-day reproducibility. Paired t-tests were used to compare means of baseline and hyperoxic peripapillary retinal blood low. Results. A decrease of 8.87% ± 3.09% (mean ± standard deviation) in flow index and 2.61% ± 1.50% in vessel density was observed under hyperoxia. The within-day repeatability CV of baseline measurements was 5.75% for flow index and 1.67% for vessel density. The between-day reproducibility CV for baseline flow index and vessel density was 11.1% and 1.14%, respectively. The between-day reproducibility of the hyperoxic response was 3.71% and 1.67% for low index and vessel density, respectively. Conclusions. Optical coherence tomography angiography with SSADA was able to detect a decrease in peripapillary retinal blood flow in response to hyperoxia. The response was larger than the variability of baseline measurements. The magnitude of an individual's hyperoxic response was highly variable between days. Thus, reliable assessment may require averaging multiple measurements.},

A practical method for the clinical evaluation of ocular perfusion is needed to improve glaucoma management. Objective To detect peripapillary retinal perfusion in glaucomatous eyes compared with normal eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective observational study performed from July 24, 2013, to April 17, 2014. Participants were recruited and tested at Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University. In total, 12 glaucomatous eyes and 12 age-matched normal eyes were analyzed. The optic disc region was imaged twice using a 3 - 3-mm scan by a 70-kHz, 840-nm-wavelength spectral OCT system. The split-spectrum amplitudedecorrelation angiography algorithm was used. Peripapillary flow index was calculated as the mean decorrelation value in the peripapillary region, defined as a 700-$\mu$m-wide elliptical annulus around the disc. Peripapillary vessel density was the percentage area occupied by vessels. The data statistical analysis was performed from October 30, 2013, to May 30, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Variabilitywas assessed by the coefficient of variation. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the 2 groups of eyes. Correlations between vascular and visual field variables were assessed by linear regression analysis. Results In 12 normal eyes, a dense microvascular network around the disc was visible on OCT angiography. In 12 glaucomatous eyes, this network was visibly attenuated globally and focally. In normal eyes, between-visit reproducibilities of peripapillary flow index and peripapillary vessel density were 4.3%and 2.7%of the coefficient of variation, respectively, while the population variabilities of peripapillary flow index and peripapillary vessel density were 8.2%and 3.0% of the coefficient of variation, respectively. Peripapillary flow index and peripapillary vessel density in glaucomatous eyes were lower than those in normal eyes (P < .001 for both). Peripapillary flow index (Pearson r = -0.808) and peripapillary vessel density (Pearson r = -0.835) were highly correlated with visual field pattern standard deviation in glaucomatous eyes (P = .001 for both). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for normal vs glaucomatous eyes were 0.892 for peripapillary flow index and 0.938 for peripapillary vessel density. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using OCT angiography, reduced peripapillary retinal perfusion in glaucomatous eyes can be visualized as focal defects and quantified as peripapillary flow index and peripapillary vessel density, with high repeatability and reproducibility. Quantitative OCT angiographymay have value in future studies to determine its potential usefulness in glaucoma evaluation.},

Projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography (PR-OCTA) enables both cross-sectional and en face visualization of CNV. However, CNV identification and segmentation remains difficult even with PR-OCTA due to the presence of residual artifacts. In this paper, a fully automated CNV diagnosis and segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is described. This study used a clinical dataset, including both scans with and without CNV, and scans of eyes with different pathologies. Furthermore, no scans were excluded due to image quality. In testing, all CNV cases were diagnosed from non-CNV controls with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The mean intersection over union of CNV membrane segmentation was as high as 0.88. By enabling fully automated categorization and segmentation, the proposed algorithm should offer benefits for CNV diagnosis, visualization monitoring.},

We propose an automated phase-unwrapping technique that takes advantage of the parabolic profile of blood flow velocity in vessels. Instead of inspecting the phase shift manually, the algorithm calculates the gradient magnitude of the phase shift on the cross-sectional image and automatically detects the presence of phase wrapping. The voxels affected by phase wrapping are corrected according to the determined flow direction adjacent to the vessel walls. We validated this technique in the rodent retina using a prototype visible-light OCT and in the human retina with a commercial infrared OCT system. We believe this signal processing method may well accelerate clinical applications of Doppler OCT in ophthalmology.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) is a novel technology capable of imaging retinal vasculature three-dimensionally at capillary scale without the need to inject any extrinsic dye contrast. However, projection artifacts cause superficial retinal vascular patterns to be duplicated in deeper layers, thus interfering with the clean visualization of some retinal plexuses and vascular pathologies. Projection-resolved OCTA (PR-OCTA) uses post-processing algorithms to reduce projection artifacts. With PR-OCTA, it is now possible to resolve up to 4 distinct retinal vascular plexuses in the living human eye. The technology also allows us to detect and distinguish between various retinal and optic nerve diseases. For example, optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma primarily reduces the capillary density in the superficial vascular complex, which comprises the nerve fiber layer plexus and the ganglion cell layer plexus. Outer retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa primarily reduce the capillary density in the deep vascular complex, which comprises the intermediate capillary plexus and the deep capillary plexus. Retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vein occlusion affect all plexuses, but with different patterns of capillary loss and vascular malformations. PR-OCTA is also useful in distinguishing various types of choroidal neovascularization and monitoring their response to anti-angiogenic medications. In retinal angiomatous proliferation and macular telangiectasia type 2, PR-OCTA can trace the pathologic vascular extension into deeper layers as the disease progress through stages. Plexus-specific visualization and measurement of retinal vascular changes are improving our ability to diagnose, stage, monitor, and assess treatment response in a wide variety of optic nerve and retinal diseases. These applications will be further enhanced with the continuing improvement of the speed and resolution of the OCT platforms, as well as the development of software algorithms to reduce artifacts, improve image quality, and make quantitative measurements.}

Participants Consecutive patients with MTP disorders evaluated at a single center from 1994 through 2015, including 18 patients with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) and 3 patients with trifunctional protein deficiency (TFPD). Methods Local records from all visits were reviewed. Every participant underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and was evaluated by a metabolic physician and dietitian. Nine patients underwent ancillary funduscopic imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity at the final visit. Secondary outcome measures included spherical equivalent refraction, visual fields, electroretinography B-wave amplitudes, and qualitative imaging findings. Results Participants were followed up for a median of 5.6 years (range 0.3–20.2 years). The median age of LCHADD participants at initial and final visits was 2.3 and 11.9 years, whereas that for TFPD participants at initial and final visits was 4.7 and 15.5 years, respectively. Four long-term survivors older than 16 years were included (3 with LCHADD and 1 with TFPD). The LCHADD participants demonstrated a steady decline in visual acuity from an average of 0.23 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/34) at baseline to 0.42 logMAR (Snellen equivalent, 20/53) at the final visit, whereas TFPD patients maintained excellent acuity throughout follow-up. Participants with LCHADD, but not TFPD, showed an increasing myopia with a mean decrease in spherical equivalent refraction of 0.24 diopters per year. Visual fields showed sensitivity losses centrally associated with defects on OCT. Multimodal imaging demonstrated progressive atrophy of the outer retina in LCHADD, often preceded by the formation of outer retinal tubulations and choriocapillaris dropout. Electroretinography findings support the more severe clinical profile of LCHADD patients compared with TFPD patients; the function of both rods and cones are attenuated diffusely in LCHADD patients, but are within normal limits for TFPD patients. Conclusions Despite improved survival with early diagnosis, medical management, and dietary treatment, participants with the LCHADD subtype of MTP disorder continue to demonstrate visually disabling chorioretinopathy. Multimodal imaging is most consistent with choriocapillaris loss exceeding photoreceptor loss.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To use multiplane en face Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the change in total retinal blood flow (TRBF) in response to hyperoxia. METHODS. One eye of each healthy human participant (n = 8) was scanned with a commercial high-speed (70-kHz) spectral OCT system. Three repeated scans were captured at baseline and after 10 minutes of oxygen (hyperoxia) by open nasal mask. The procedure was performed twice on day 1 and once more on day 2. Blood flow of each vein was estimated using Doppler OCT at an optimized en face plane. The TRBF was summed from all veins at the optic disc. The TRBF hyperoxic response was calculated as the TRBF percent change from baseline. RESULTS. Participants experienced a 23.6% ± 10.7% (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) decrease (P < 0.001, paired t-test) in TRBF during hyperoxia. The within-day repeatability of baseline TRBF was 4.1% and the between-day reproducibility was 10.9% coefficient of variation (CV). Between-grader reproducibility was 3.9% CV. The repeatability and reproducibility (pooled SD) of hyperoxic response were 6.1% and 6.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The multiplane en face Doppler OCT algorithm was able to detect, in all participants, a decreased TRBF in response to hyperoxia. The response magnitude for each participant varied among repeated trials, and the averaging of multiple trials was helpful in establishing the individual response. This technique shows good potential for the clinical investigation of vascular autoregulation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To study peripapillary retinal capillary circulation in eyes treated with iodine 125 (I125) plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Design: Cross-sectional study of 10 participants imaged with OCTA before uveal melanoma treatment and 15 participants imaged after development of radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, or both. Participants: After institutional review board approval, participants were enrolled from an academic ocular oncology clinical practice. All participants had uveal melanoma in 1 eye, and treatment with I125 plaque brachytherapy was planned or had taken place previously. Patients with low vision at baseline and uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. In the posttreatment group, 7 participants were men and 8 were women; age range was 38 to 81 years. Visual acuities in the irradiated eyes ranged from 20/20 to counting fingers. Visual acuities in the untreated fellow eyes were 20/25 or better. Methods: Peripapillary retinal capillary circulation was measured by OCTA (Optovue, Inc). Optic disc scans measuring 4.5 × 4.5 mm were obtained. Main Outcome Measures: The relationship of the peripapillary retinal capillary density (PPCD) as measured by OCTA to the calculated dose to the optic nerve (the dose to 50% of the disc [D50]) and visual acuity in logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units were evaluated. Results: No significant differences were observed in the PPCD as measured by OCTA when comparing the eye with melanoma with the fellow eye before brachytherapy; however, the PPCD was significantly lower in treated eyes (52.9% ± 22.4%) than in fellow eyes that did not receive radiation (73.3% ± 13.7%; P = 0.004). There was an inverse linear correlation between D50 and the PPCD (Pearson's r = −0.528; P = 0.043) and between visual acuity and the PPCD (Pearson's r = −0.564; P = 0.028). Conclusions: Among patients with clinically apparent radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy, or both, PPCD was lower in the treated eye and correlated with the radiation dose to the optic nerve and the visual acuity. Optical coherence tomography angiography provides a measure of capillary changes after radiation and may serve as a quantitative end point to address visual prognosis.},

Non-perfusion area (NPA) is a quantitative biomarker useful for characterizing ischemia in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography (PR-OCTA) allows visualization of retinal capillaries and quantify NPA in individual plexuses. However, poor scan quality can make current NPA detection algorithms unreliable and inaccurate. In this work, we present a robust NPA detection algorithm using convolutional neural network (CNN). By merging information from OCT angiograms and OCT reflectance images, the CNN could exclude signal reduction and motion artifacts and detect the avascular features from local to global with the resolution preserved. Across a wide range of signal strength indices, and on both healthy and DR eyes, the algorithm achieved high accuracy and repeatability.},

Methods: Eyes were imaged using an OCT system operating at 840 nm and using the split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation algorithm. A novel algorithm suppressed projection artifacts inherent to OCTA.

Results: Eight illustrative cases are described. In cases of diabetic retinopathy, retinal vessel occlusion, and retinitis pigmentosa, PR-OCTA detected retinal nonperfusion regions within deeper retinal plexuses not visualized by conventional OCTA. In age-related macular degeneration, cross-sectional PR-OCTA allowed the classification of choroidal neovascularization, and, in a case of retinal angiomatous proliferation, identified a vertical vessel contiguous with the deep capillary plexus. In macular telangiectasia, PR-OCTA detected a diving perifoveal vein and delineated subretinal neovascularization.

Participants: Healthy volunteers. Methods: OCT angiography images obtained from healthy volunteers were analyzed to demonstrate the relationship between signal strength index (SSI) and VD. Experiments were performed to determine the effects of signal strength reduction on VD measurements on the Optovue/AngioVue (Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA) and Cirrus/AngioPlex OCTA (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA) systems. Signal strength reduction was generated by either neutral density filters (NDFs) or defocus. Main Outcome Measures: Regression analysis of signal strength effects on VD. Results: Vessel density decreased linearly with signal strength with high statistical significance on both OCTA systems tested and for all analyzed sources of variation in signal strength. The slope of VD versus SSI was greatest when signal strength was adjusted by NDFs, followed by defocus, interscan difference, interindividual variation, and left–right eye difference. Multivariate analysis revealed that both SSI and age had a significant effect on the interindividual variation in VD. Conclusions: Vessel density measurements using OCTA were affected significantly by OCT signal strengths on 2 OCTA platforms. Investigators should exercise caution when interpreting VD data from OCTA scans. Quantification algorithms for OCTA should ideally remove the signal strength bias.},

Advances in the retinal layer segmentation of structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) images have allowed the separation of capillary plexuses in OCT angiography (OCTA). With the increased scanning speeds of OCT devices and wider field images (≥10 mm on fast-axis), greater retinal curvature and anatomic variations have introduced new challenges. In this study, we developed a novel automated method to segment seven retinal layer boundaries and two retinal plexuses in wide-field OCTA images. The algorithm was initialized by a series of points forming a guidance point array that estimates the location of retinal layer boundaries. A guided bidirectional graph search method consisting of an improvement of our previous segmentation algorithm was used to search for the precise boundaries. We validated the method on normal and diseased eyes, demonstrating subpixel accuracy for all groups. By allowing independent visualization of the superficial and deep plexuses, this method shows potential for the detection of plexus-specific peripheral vascular abnormalities.},

We developed a novel algorithm to remove this artifact by resolving the ambiguity between in situ and projected flow signals. The algorithm identifies voxels with in situ flow as those where intensity-normalized decorrelation values are higher than all shallower voxels in the same axial scan line. This “projection-resolved” (PR) algorithm effectively suppressed the projection artifact on both en face and cross-sectional angiograms and enhanced depth resolution of vascular networks. In the human macula, the enhanced angiograms show three distinct vascular plexuses in the inner retina and no vessels in the outer retina.

Methods: Eyes with drusen, pigmentary changes, and with CNV in the fellow eye were scanned with a 70-kHz spectral domain OCT system (Optovue RTVue-XR Avanti). The splitspectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm was used to distinguish blood flow from static tissue. Two masked graders reviewed scans for CNV, defined as flow in the outer retinal/sub-RPE slab. Choroidal neovascularization flow area repeatability and between-grader reproducibility were calculated. Results: Of 32 eyes, 2 (6%) were found to have Type 1 CNV with OCT angiography. The lesions were not associated with leakage on fluorescein angiography or fluid on OCT. One case was followed for 8 months without treatment, and the CNV flow area enlarged slightly without fluid buildup on OCT or vision loss. Between-grader reproducibility of the CNV flow area was 9.4% (coefficient of variation) and within-visit repeatability was 5.2% (pooled coefficient of variation). Conclusion: Optical coherence tomographic angiography can detect the presence of nonexudative CNV, lesions difficult to identify with fluorescein angiography and OCT.

Orthogonal registration can eliminate the majority of these artifacts, but some artifacts persist in most clinical images. We evaluate an automated registration algorithm with selective merging and filtering to remove remaining artifacts and improve the quality of images. Methods: A 70 kHz commercial spectral domain OCT was used to obtain 3 mm × 3 mm OCTA in 10 healthy, 5 age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and 31 diabetic retinopathy (DR) participants. Projection artifacts were removed and images were segmented into 3 inner retinal plexuses. Amplitude thresholding identified lines containing a residual artifact and correlation between neighboring lines identified distorted stripes. Then the angiograms were registered and the lines selectively merged. A vesselness filter was applied to the resulting images. The images were evaluated for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image entropy, vessel connectivity and vessel density. Results: Registration and selective merging (RSM) algorithm improved the SNR (P<0.02) compared to orthogonal registration alone. RSM with vesselness filter increased the image entropy (P<10-8) and reduced inter-subject variability (standard error ≤3%, n=10) in healthy eyes. The method improved vessel details and connectivity in OCTA of healthy, DR and neovascular AMD eyes. Conclusions: This automated registration method eliminates residual motion artifacts and enhances the visualization of vessels in OCTA.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement. Frequently, when imaging retinal vasculature with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in diseased eyes, there are unavoidable obstacles to the propagation of light such as vitreous floaters or the pupil boundary. These obstacles can block the optical coherence tomography (OCT) beam and impede the visualization of the underlying retinal microcirculation. Detecting these shadow artifacts is especially important in the quantification of metrics that assess retinal disease progression because they might masquerade as regional perfusion loss. In this work, we present an algorithm to identify shadowed areas in OCTA of healthy subjects as well as patients with diabetic retinopathy, uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. The aim is to exclude these areas from analysis so that the overall OCTA parameters are minimally affected by shadow artifacts.},

In this paper, we studied the organization of the arterial and venous retinal circulation in rats using vis-OCT. Arterioles were found predominantly in the superficial vascular plexus whereas veins tended to drain capillaries from the deep capillary plexus. After that, we determined the oxygen metabolic rate supported by retinal microcirculation by combining retinal vessel oxygen saturation and blood flow measurements. The ability to visualize and monitor retinal circulation organization and oxygen metabolism by vis-OCT may provide new opportunities for understanding the pathology of ocular diseases.},

To improve optic disc boundary detection and peripapillary retinal layer segmentation, we propose an automated approach for structural and angiographic optical coherence tomography. The algorithm was performed on radial cross-sectional B-scans. The disc boundary was detected by searching for the position of Bruch's membrane opening, and retinal layer boundaries were detected using a dynamic programming-based graph search algorithm on each B-scan without the disc region. A comparison of the disc boundary using our method with that determined by manual delineation showed good accuracy, with an average Dice similarity coefficient ≥0.90 in healthy eyes and eyes with diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. The layer segmentation accuracy in the same cases was on average less than one pixel (3.13 $\mu$m).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To characterize the density and distribution of the radial peripapillary capillary plexus (RPCP) and its relationship with retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness in healthy subjects. METHODS. Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography algorithm and automated montaging, wide-field OCT angiography (OCTA) was used to measure the RPCP capillary density (CD) and NFL thickness. Polar sector-average CD and thickness maps were also created on each eye. RESULTS. Wide-field OCTA (8 × 8 mm) in 10 healthy eyes from 10 subjects demonstrated the distribution of the RPCP throughout the posterior pole. RPCP-CD decreases with distance from the disc, but along the arcuate nerve fiber bundles relatively dense (> half maximum density) RPCP extends more than 5 mm from the disc and includes regions superior to and inferior to the macula. The RPCP-CD and NFL thickness are highly correlated (R2 = 0.85, P < 0.001) and fit well with a nonlinear stacked-layer model. The model fit suggests that the RPCP is present when the NFL is thicker than 17.9 $\mu$m and reaches a ceiling area density of 84% and that the RPCP has an apparent volume density of 19% at the current instrument transverse resolution. This indicates that capillary overlap can be expected to occur when NFL thickness reaches 40 $\mu$m. CONCLUSIONS. The wide distribution of dense overlapping RPCP suggests that wider (up to 8 mm vertical and 7 mm horizontal) OCTA scans may be better investigate capillary loss in the early stages of glaucoma or other optic neuropathies.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) results in painless, catastrophic vision loss in a period of seconds. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can image retinal microcirculation, which is helpful to evaluate treatment response during the follow-up period. Using a single case with central RAO, we report its retinal perfusion changes before and after treatment using OCTA. Patient concerns: A 36-year-old Chinese man came to our clinic with a sudden, painless loss of vision (hand motion) in his left eye. A vasodilator (nicotinic acid) was used as the primary treatment. OCTA imaging and a visual field examination were performed to assess the retinal perfusion changes before and after treatment. Diagnosis: Retinal artery occlusion was considered. Interventions: This patient was treated with an inhaled oxygen-carbon dioxide mixture, nicotinic acid tablets (100 mg) taken orally twice a day, and intravenous infusion of nicotinic acid injections (60 mg) combined with 0.9% sodium chloride injections (100 ml) once a day for vasodilation. Outcomes: After treatment and 9 months of follow-up, the vessel density of the left eye at the 9-month follow-up appointment was improved in all quadrants. Lessons: Retinal edema and retinal atrophy were observed at the RAO onset and several months later, respectively. However, macular perfusion gradually increased after treatment. The timely administration of a vasodilator and the presence of the cilioretinal artery play important roles in the prevention of profound vision loss.},

This allowed 2 beams to shine on the cornea at an angle separation of $\sim$14°, which led to a separation of $\sim$4.2 mm on the retina. A 3-mm glass plate was inserted into one of the beam paths to set a constant path length difference between the 2 polarized beams so the interferogram from the 2 beams are coded at different frequency bands. The resulting OCTA images from the 2 beams were coded with a depth separation of $\sim$2 mm. A total of 5 × 5 mm2 angiograms from the 2 beams were obtained simultaneously in 4 seconds. The 2 angiograms then were montaged to get a wider FOV of $\sim$5 × 9.2 mm2.},

Methods: We obtained 3 × 3-mm macular OCTA scans in diabetic patients with various levels of DR and healthy controls. An algorithm based on a generalized gradient vector flow (GGVF) snake model detected the FAZ, and metrics assessing FAZ size and irregularity were calculated. We compared the automated FAZ segmentation to manual delineation and tested the within-visit repeatability of FAZ metrics. The correlations of two conventional FAZ metrics, two novel FAZ metrics, and EAA with DR severity and BCVA, as determined by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts, were assessed. Results: Sixty-six eyes from 66 diabetic patients and 19 control eyes from 19 healthy participants were included. The agreement between manual and automated FAZ delineation had a Jaccard index > 0.82, and the repeatability of automated FAZ detection was excellent in eyes at all levels of DR severity. FAZ metrics that incorporated both FAZ size and shape irregularity had the strongest correlation with clinical DR grade and BCVA. Of all the tested OCTA metrics, EAA had the greatest sensitivity in differentiating diabetic eyes without clinical evidence of retinopathy, mild to moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and severe NPDR to proliferative DR from healthy controls. Conclusions: The GGVF snake algorithm tested in this study can accurately and reliably detect the FAZ, using OCTA data at all DR severity grades, and may be used to obtain clinically useful information from OCTA data regarding macular ischemia in patients with diabetes. While FAZ metrics can provide clinically useful information regarding macular ischemia, and possibly visual acuity potential, EAA measurements may be a better biomarker for DR.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) can image the retinal blood flow but visualization of the capillary caliber is limited by the low lateral resolution. Adaptive optics (AO) can be used to compensate ocular aberrations when using high numerical aperture (NA), and thus improve image resolution. However, previously reported AO-OCTA instruments were large and complex, and have a small sub-millimeter field of view (FOV) that hinders the extraction of biomarkers with clinical relevance. In this manuscript, we developed a sensorless AO-OCTA prototype with an intermediate numerical aperture to produce depth-resolved angiograms with high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio over a 2 × 2 mm FOV, with a focal spot diameter of 6 µm, which is about 3 times finer than typical commercial OCT systems. We believe these parameters may represent a better tradeoff between resolution and FOV compared to large-NA AO systems, since the spot size matches better that of capillaries. The prototype corrects defocus, astigmatism, and coma using a figure of merit based on the mean reflectance projection of a slab defined with real-time segmentation of retinal layers. AO correction with the ability to optimize focusing in arbitrary retinal depths – particularly the plexuses in the inner retina – could be achieved in 1.35 seconds. The AO-OCTA images showed greater flow signal, signal-to-noise ratio, and finer capillary caliber compared to commercial OCTA. Projection artifacts were also reduced in the intermediate and deep capillary plexuses. The instrument reported here improves OCTA image quality without excessive sacrifice in FOV and device complexity, and thus may have potential for clinical translation.},

Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Study participants underwent macular 3- × 3-mm OCTA scans with spectral domain OCTA. Reflectance-compensated retinal vessel densities were calculated on projection-resolved superficial vascular complex (SVC), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP). Quantitative analysis using normalized deviation compared the retinal vessel density in GA regions, 500-$\mu$m GA rim regions, and non-GA regions to similar macular locations in control eyes. Results: Ten eyes with GA and 10 control eyes were studied. Eyes with GA had significantly lower vessel density in the SVC (54.8 ± 2.4% vs. 60.8 ± 3.1%; P < 0.001), ICP (34.0 ± 1.5% vs. 37.3 ± 1.7%; P = 0.003) and DCP (24.4 ± 2.3% vs. 28.0 ± 2.3%; P < 0.001) than control eyes. Retinal vessel density within the GA region decreased significantly in SVC, ICP, and DCP. Retinal vessel density in the GA rim region decreased in SVC and ICP but not in DCP. The non-GA region did not significantly deviate from normal controls. Eyes with GA had significantly reduced photoreceptor layer thickness; but similar nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell complex, inner nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer thickness. Conclusions: Eyes with GA have reduced retinal vessel density in SVC, ICP, and DCP compared to those in controls. Loss is greatest within regions of GA. Vessel density may be more sensitive than retinal layer thickness measurement in the detection of inner retinal change in eyes with GA.},

PFI measurements were taken in 15 second intervals during a 4 minute period consisting of 1 minute of baseline, 2 minutes with an 8 Hz reversing checkerboard pattern stimulation, and 1 minute without stimulation. PFI measurements increased 6.1±4.7% (p = .001) during the first minute of stimulation, with the most significant increase in PFI occurring 30 seconds into stimulation (p<0.001).

Flow signal was calculated by the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm. A projection-resolved OCTA (PR-OCTA) algorithm was used to remove flow projection artifacts. Four en face OCTA slabs were analyzed: the superficial vascular complex (SVC), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and all-plexus retina (SVC + ICP + DCP). The vessel density (VD), defined as the percentage area occupied by flow pixels, was calculated from en face OCTA. A novel algorithm was used to adjust the vessel density to compensate for local variations in OCT signal strength. Main Outcome Measures Macular retinal VD, ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, and visual field (VF) sensitivity. Results Focal capillary dropout could be visualized in the SVC, but not the ICP and DVP, in glaucomatous eyes. In the glaucoma group, the SVC and all-plexus retinal VD (mean ± standard deviation: 47.2%±7.1% and 73.5%±6.6%) were lower than in the normal group (60.5%±4.0% and 83.2%±4.2%, both P < 0.001, t test). The ICP and DCP VD were not significantly lower in the glaucoma group. Among the overall macular VD parameters, the SVC VD had the best diagnostic accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). The accuracy was even better when the worse hemisphere (inferior or superior) was used, achieving an AROC of 0.983 and a sensitivity of 96.7% at a specificity of 95%. Among the glaucoma participants, the hemispheric SVC VD values were highly correlated with the corresponding GCC thickness and VF sensitivity (P < 0.003). The reflectance compensation step in VD calculation significantly improved repeatability, normal population variation, and correlation with VF and GCC thickness. Conclusions On the basis of PR-OCTA, glaucoma preferentially affects perfusion in the SVC in the macula more than the deeper plexuses. Reflectance-compensated SVC VD measurement by PR-OCTA detected glaucoma with high accuracy and could be useful in the clinical evaluation of glaucoma.},

  abstract = {Aim The aim of the study was to investigate the interchangeability and reliability of macular perfusion measurements using optical coherence tomography angiography. Methods A prospective cross-sectional observational study. Healthy adult Chinese subjects were recruited. Macular perfusion parameters were automatically analysed by software included in a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system. The vessel density (VD) of the whole, parafovea, superior-hemi, inferior-hemi, fovea, temporal, superior, nasal and inferior quadrants as well as the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and choroidal capillary VD (CCVD) were quantified. Results A total of 51 eyes in 27 subjects were included (8 men and 19 women, mean age 24±4 years). Significant differences in VD of all quadrants (all p<0.001) was detected between the 3×3 mm and 6×6 mm macular scan size. The biggest difference of VD between the two scan size was 5.14±4.03, which was not clinically meaningful. No statistically significant differences were found in FAZ or CCVD between the two different scan sizes. The mean intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between two measurements from the inter-rater of 20 eyes was from 0.560 to 0.893 for VD and 0.845 for FAZ. The mean ICC between two measurements from the intrarater of 20 eyes was from 0.497 to 0.870 for VD and 0.780 for FAZ. Conclusions FAZ and CCVD are interchangeable between the 3×3 mm and 6×6 mm macular scan sizes. The VD differences between the two different scan sizes are not clinically meaningful. The macular perfusion parameters presented good but not perfect reliability, which should be acknowledged in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been classified in two groups, neovascular and non-neovascular, which historically has been synonymous with exudative and non-exudative, respectively. Neovascular AMD occurs when pathologic blood vessels, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), arise from the choroid and extend above Bruch's membrane toward the outer retina. Often these vessels are exudative in nature, resulting in leakage of fluid, lipid exudate, or blood causing vision loss. The exudation from CNV allows detection as leakage with dye based angiography and as fluid with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT). In 2013, Querques et al. used multi-model imaging to detect treatment na{\"{i}}ve quiescent CNV (1). This diagnosis requires presence of (I) moderate reflective material between an elevated retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane on spectral domain OCT; (II) absence of fluid on OCT; (III) staining with fluorescein angiography; and (IV) a plaque identified with indocyanine green angiography. This study confirmed the existence of non-exudative neovascular AMD, and that exudation is not required for the presence of CNV. OCT angiography (OCTA), which can detect CNV as moving blood cells in the outer retinal slab (2) rather than relying on the presence of leakage on FA or fluid on OCT, is an ideal imaging modality to further study non-exudative CNV. In 2015, Palejwala et al. first described the use of OCTA to detect non-exudative CNV (3). In this study, 32 fellow eyes of patients with neovascular AMD were scanned using OCTA. Two cases of clinically silent non-exudative CNV were found as flow in the outer retinal slab without exudation on structural OCT and without leakage on fluorescein angiography. One case was followed longitudinally and over 8 months, the CNV vessel area enlarged by 20%, however, exudation never developed. Several other studies have subsequently further characterized non-exudative CNV using OCT angiography (4-7). The recent study by Carnevali et al. aimed to describe features of treatment na{\"{i}}ve quiescent CNV (TNQ-CNV) and estimate the detection rate by OCTA (7). This was an observational},

  abstract = {Purpose To detect and quantify choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Design Observational, cross-sectional study. Participants A total of 5 normal subjects and 5 subjects with neovascular AMD were included. Methods A total of 5 eyes with neovascular AMD and 5 normal age-matched controls were scanned by a high-speed (100 000 A-scans/seconds) 1050-nm wavelength swept-source OCT. The macular angiography scan covered a 3×3-mm area and comprised 200×200×8 A-scans acquired in 3.5 seconds. Flow was detected using the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm. Motion artifacts were removed by 3-dimensional (3D) orthogonal registration and merging of 4 scans. The 3D angiography was segmented into 3 layers: inner retina (to show retinal vasculature), outer retina (to identify CNV), and choroid. En face maximum projection was used to obtain 2-dimensional angiograms from the 3 layers. The CNV area and flow index were computed from the en face OCT angiogram of the outer retinal layer. Flow (decorrelation) and structural data were combined in composite color angiograms for both en face and cross-sectional views. Main Outcome Measures The CNV angiogram, CNV area, and CNV flow index. Results En face OCT angiograms of CNV showed sizes and locations that were confirmed by fluorescein angiography (FA). Optical coherence tomography angiography provided more distinct vascular network patterns that were less obscured by subretinal hemorrhage. The en face angiograms also showed areas of reduced choroidal flow adjacent to the CNV in all cases and significantly reduced retinal flow in 1 case. Cross-sectional angiograms were used to visualize CNV location relative to the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's layer and classify type I and type II CNV. A feeder vessel could be identified in 1 case. Higher flow indexes were associated with larger CNV and type II CNV. Conclusions Optical coherence tomography angiography provides depth-resolved information and detailed images of CNV in neovascular AMD. Quantitative information regarding CNV flow and area can be obtained. Further studies are needed to assess the role of quantitative OCT angiography in the evaluation and treatment of neovascular AMD.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: To measure low perfusion areas (LPAs) and focal perfusion loss (FPL) in the peripapillary retina using OCT angiography (OCTA) in glaucoma. Design: Prospective, observational study. Participants: A total of 47 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and 36 normal participants were analyzed. Methods: One eye of each subject was scanned using an AngioVue (Optovue, Fremont, CA) 4.5-mm OCTA scan centered on the disc. En face nerve fiber layer (NFL) plexus angiogram was generated. With the use of custom software, a capillary density map was obtained by computing the fraction of area occupied by flow pixels after low-pass filtering by local averaging 21×21 pixels. The low-perfusion map is defined by local capillary density below 0.5 percentile over a contiguous area above 98.5 percentile of the normal reference population. The LPA parameter is the cumulative area, and the FPL is the percent capillary density loss (relative to normal mean) integrated over the LPA. Main Outcome Measures: Peripapillary retinal LPA and FPL. Results: Among patients with POAG, 3 had preperimetric glaucoma and 44 had perimetric glaucoma, with visual field (VF) mean deviation (MD) of −5.14±4.25 decibels (dB). The LPA was 3.40±2.29 mm2 in those with POAG and 0.11±0.18 mm2 in normal subjects (P < 0.001). The FPL was 21.8%±17.0% in those with POAG and 0.3%±0.7% in normal subjects (P < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.965 for both LPA and FPL, with a sensitivity of 93.7% at 95% specificity. The repeatability as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.977 for LPA and 0.958 for FPL. The FPL had excellent correlation with VF MD (Spearman's rho = −0.843), which was significantly (P = 0.008) better than the correlation between NFL thickness and VF MD (rho = 0.760). The hemispheric difference correlation between FPL and VF (Spearman's rho = 0.770) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than the hemispheric difference correlation between LPA and VF (rho = 0.595). Conclusions: The low-perfusion map and LPA and FPL parameters are able to assess the location and severity of focal glaucoma damage with good agreement with VF.},

Phase-based optical coherence tomography (OCT), such as OCT angiography (OCTA) and Doppler OCT, is sensitive to the confounding phase shift introduced by subject bulk motion. Traditional bulk motion compensation methods are limited by their accuracy and computing cost-effectiveness. In this Letter, to the best of our knowledge, we present a novel bulk motion compensation method for phase-based functional OCT. Bulk motion associated phase shift can be directly derived by solving its equation using a standard deviation of phase-based OCTA and Doppler OCT flow signals. This method was evaluated on rodent retinal images acquired by a prototype visible light OCT and human retinal images acquired by a commercial system. The image quality and computational speed were significantly improved, compared to two conventional phase compensation methods.},

  abstract = {An automated algorithm was developed for total retinal blood flow (TRBF) using 70-kHz spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT). The OCT was calibrated for the transformation from Doppler shift to speed based on a flow phantom. The TRBF scan pattern contained five repeated volume scans (2 x 2 mm) obtained in 3 s and centered on central retinal vessels in the optic disc. The TRBF was calculated using an en face Doppler technique. For each retinal vein, blood flow was measured at an optimal plane where the calculated flow was maximized. The TRBF was calculated by summing flow in all veins. The algorithm tracked vascular branching so that either root or branch veins are summed, but never both. The TRBF in five repeated volumes were averaged to reduce variation due to cardiac cycle pulsation. Finally, the TRBF was corrected for eye length variation. Twelve healthy eyes and 12 glaucomatous eyes were enrolled to test the algorithm. The TRBF was 45.4 ± 6.7 $\mu$l/min for healthy control and 34.7 ± 7.6 $\mu$l/min for glaucomatous participants (p-value = 0.01). The intravisit repeatability was 8.6% for healthy controls and 8.4% for glaucoma participants. The proposed automated method provided repeatable TRBF measurement.},

In recent years it has become unequivocally clear that mitochondrial complexes of the ETC are not static entities in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These complexes are dynamic and in mammals they aggregate in different stoichiometric combinations to form supercomplexes (SCs) or respirasomes. It has been proposed that the net respiration is more efficient via SCs than via isolated complexes. However, it still needs to be determined whether the activity of a particular SC is associated with a disease etiology. Here we describe a simplified method to visualize and assess in-gel activity of SCs and the individual complexes with good resolution using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE).},

  abstract = {A phase gradient angiography (PGA) method is proposed for optical coherence tomography (OCT). This method allows the use of phase information to map the microvasculature in tissue without the correction of bulk motion and laser trigger jitter induced phase artifacts. PGA can also be combined with the amplitude/intensity to improve the performance. Split-spectrum technique can further increase the signal to noise ratio by more than two times. In-vivo imaging of human retinal circulation is shown with a 70 kHz, 840 nm spectral domain OCT system and a 200 kHz, 1050 nm swept source OCT system. Four different OCT angiography methods are compared. The best performance was achieved with split-spectrum amplitude and phase-gradient angiography.},

  abstract      = {Purpose: We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), named Retinal Fluid Segmentation Network (ReF-Net) to segment volumetric retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume. Methods: 3 x 3-mm OCT scans were acquired on one eye by a 70-kHz OCT commercial AngioVue system (RTVue-XR; Optovue, Inc.) from 51 participants in a clinical diabetic retinopathy (DR) study (45 with retinal edema and 6 healthy controls). A CNN with U-Net-like architecture was constructed to detect and segment the retinal fluid. Cross-sectional OCT and angiography (OCTA) scans were used for training and testing ReF-Net. The effect of including OCTA data for retinal fluid segmentation was investigated in this study. Volumetric retinal fluid can be constructed using the output of ReF-Net. Area-under-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curve (AROC), intersection-over-union (IoU), and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the performance of ReF-Net. Results: ReF-Net shows high accuracy (F1 = 0.864 +/- 0.084) in retinal fluid segmentation. The performance can be further improved (F1 = 0.892 +/- 0.038) by including information from both OCTA and structural OCT. ReF-Net also shows strong robustness to shadow artifacts. Volumetric retinal fluid can provide more comprehensive information than the 2D area, whether cross-sectional or en face projections. Conclusions: A deep-learning-based method can accurately segment retinal fluid volumetrically on OCT/OCTA scans with strong robustness to shadow artifacts. OCTA data can improve retinal fluid segmentation. Volumetric representations of retinal fluid are superior to 2D projections. Translational Relevance: Using a deep learning method to segment retinal fluid volumetrically has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of diabetic macular edema by OCT systems.},

  abstract  = {Purpose To evaluate tumor vasculature with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in malignant iris melanomas and benign iris lesions. Design Cross-sectional observational clinical study. Participants Patients with iris lesions and healthy volunteers. Methods Eyes were imaged using OCTA systems operating at 1050- and 840-nm wavelengths. Three-dimensional OCTA scans were acquired. Iris melanoma patients treated with radiation therapy were imaged again after I-125 plaque brachytherapy at 6 and 18 months. Main Outcome Measures OCT and OCTA images, qualitative evaluation of iris and tumor vasculature, and quantitative vessel density. Results One eye each of 8 normal volunteers and 9 patients with iris melanomas or benign iris lesions, including freckles, nevi, and an iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cyst, were imaged. The normal iris has radially oriented vessels within the stroma on OCTA. Penetration of flow signal in normal iris depended on iris color, with best penetration seen in light to moderately pigmented irides. Iris melanomas demonstrated tortuous and disorganized intratumoral vasculature. In 2 eyes with nevi there was no increased vascularity; in another, fine vascular loops were noted near an area of ectropion uveae. Iris freckles and the IPE cyst did not have intrinsic vascularity. The vessel density was significantly higher within iris melanomas (34.5%±9.8%, P < 0.05) than in benign iris nevi (8.0%±1.4%) or normal irides (8.0%±1.2%). Tumor regression after radiation therapy for melanomas was associated with decreased vessel density. OCTA at 1050 nm provided better visualization of tumor vasculature and penetration through thicker tumors than at 840 nm. But in very thick tumors and highly pigmented lesions even 1050-nm OCTA could not visualize their full thickness. Interpretable OCTA images were obtained in 82% of participants in whom imaging was attempted. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of OCTA in iris tumors. OCTA may provide a dye-free, no-injection, cost-effective method for monitoring a variety of tumors, including iris melanocytic lesions, for growth and vascularity. This could be helpful in evaluating tumors for malignant transformation and response to treatment. Penetration of the OCT beam remains a limitation for highly pigmented tumors, as does the inability to image the entire iris in a single field.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the morphological structure of illdefined choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) with traditional fluorescein angiography (FA) compared with optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA). Methods A retrospective case series study of 11 eyes with ill-defined CNV on FA was performed. Eyes were scanned with commercially available spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (70 000 A-scans/s). The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm was used to distinguish blood flow from static tissue. En face OCT angiograms were compared with FA. Results Eleven cases of ill-defined CNV on FA were identified from 10 study participants. Mean age of the participants was 74.5±6.8 years. Six cases had late leakage from undetermined source (LLUS) and five had fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment (FVPED). Combining cross-sectional structural OCT with OCT angiograms, all cases were found to have type 1 CNV that corresponded to occult CNV with FA. In all cases of occult CNV on FA, distinct vascular structures were visible with OCTA in the outer retinal/retinal pigment epithelium slab. The mean CNV vessel area was 2.61 ±3.65 mm2. The mean CNV vessel area in cases with FVPED was larger than that in cases with LLUS (4.69 ±4.72 mm2 compared with 0.85±0.90 mm2, Mann- Whitney p value=0.04). Conclusions Although the sample size is small to draw conclusions and the nature of work is retrospective and descriptive, OCTA has the potential to improve visualisation of ill-defined CNV with dye-based angiography, including occult CNV.},

Objective To detect optic nerve damage using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography in MS. Methods Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (NFL) thickness, macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and Optic Nerve Head Flow Index (ONH-FI) were measured. The ONH-FI was defined as flow signal averaged over the optic disc. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AROC). Results Sixty-eight eyes of 45 MS participants and 55 eyes of 32 healthy controls (HCs) were analysed. Of MS eyes, 25 had a history of ON (MS+ON) and 43 didn't (MS{\^{a}} 'ON). MS{\^{a}} 'ON and MS+ON eyes had reductions in ONH-FI (p=0.031 and p=0.001, respectively), GCC thickness (p=0.245 and p<0.001, respectively), and NFL thickness (p=0.003 and p=0.024, respectively), compared with HCs. The highest AROC (0.940) was achieved by the logistic regression combination of all three variables, which was significantly higher than other variables (p=0.018). Conclusion MS produces both retinal structural loss and decreased ONH perfusion in MS eyes with and without history of ON. The combination of perfusion and structural measurements enhances detection of optic nerve damage in MS. OCT angiography may be a useful additional retinal marker in evaluation of ON in MS.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To compensate for reflectance variation when quantifying vessel density by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). METHODS. Healthy participants received 636-mm macular and 4.534.5-mm optic nerve head (ONH) angiography scans on a 70-kHz spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system. The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm was used to compute the OCTA signal. Mean reflectance projection and maximum decorrelation projection were used to create en face OCT and OCTA images. Background OCTA noise in static tissue was evaluated in the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Vessel density was calculated from en face retinal OCTA that was binarized according to a decorrelation threshold. RESULTS. The average retinal decorrelation noise in the FAZ was linearly related to the average logarithmic-scale OCT reflectance signal. Based on this relationship, a reflectance-adjusted decorrelation threshold equation was developed to filter out 97.5% of background OCTA noise. A fixed threshold was also used for comparison. The superficial vascular complex vessel density in the macula and ONH were significantly correlated with reflectance signal strength index (SSI) using the fixed threshold. This correlation was removed by using the reflectance-adjusted threshold. Reflectance compensation reduced population variation in 25 healthy eyes from 8.5% to 4.8% (coefficient of variation) in the macula and from 6.7% to 5.4% in the peripapillary region. Within-visit repeatability also improved from 4.4% to 1.8% in the macula and from 3% to 1.7% in the peripapillary region. CONCLUSIONS. Compensating for reflectance variation resulted in more reliable vessel density quantification in OCTA.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of automated quantification of capillary nonperfusion as a potential sign of macular ischemia using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational study conducted in a tertiary, subspecialty, academic practice evaluated macular nonperfusion with 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography obtained with commercially available 70-kHz OCT and fluorescein angiography (FA). The study was conducted from January 22 to September 18, 2014. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2014, to April 7, 2015. Participants included 12 individuals with normal vision serving as controls and 12 patients with various levels of DR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preplanned primary measures were parafoveal and perifoveal vessel density, total avascular area, and foveal avascular zone as detected with 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography and analyzed using an automated algorithm. Secondary measures included the agreement of the avascular area between the OCT angiogram and FA. RESULTS: Compared with the 12 healthy controls (11 women; mean [SD] age, 54.2 [14.2] years), the 12 participants with DR (4 women; mean [SD] age, 55.1 [12.1] years) had reduced parafoveal and perifoveal vessel density by 12.6% (95% CI, 7.7%-17.5%; P < .001) and 10.4% (95% CI, 6.8%-14.1%; P < .001), respectively. Total avascular area and foveal avascular zone area were greater in eyes with DR by 0.82 mm2 (95% CI, 0.65-0.99 mm2; P = .02) and 0.16 mm2 (95% CI, 0.05-0.28 mm2; P < .001). The agreement between the vascular areas in the OCT angiogram and FA had a $\kappa$ value of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.21-0.70; P < .001). Total avascular area in the central 5.5-mm-diameter area distinguished eyes with DR from control eyes with 100% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Avascular area analysis with an automated algorithm using OCT angiography, although not equivalent to FA, detected DR reliably in this small pilot study. Further study is necessary to determine the usefulness of the automated quantification in clinical practice.},

  abstract  = {Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive method of 3D imaging of the retinal and choroidal circulations. However, vascular depth discrimination is limited by superficial vessels projecting flow signal artifact onto deeper layers. The projection-resolved (PR) OCTA algorithm improves depth resolution by removing projection artifact while retaining in-situ flow signal from real blood vessels in deeper layers. This novel technology allowed us to study the normal retinal vasculature in vivo with better depth resolution than previously possible. Our investigation in normal human volunteers revealed the presence of 2 to 4 distinct vascular plexuses in the retina, depending on location relative to the optic disc and fovea. The vascular pattern in these retinal plexuses and interconnecting layers are consistent with previous histologic studies. Based on these data, we propose an improved system of nomenclature and segmentation boundaries for detailed 3-dimensional retinal vascular anatomy by OCTA. This could serve as a basis for future investigation of both normal retinal anatomy, as well as vascular malformations, nonperfusion, and neovascularization.},

We propose a novel automated volumetric segmentation method to detect and quantify retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT). The fuzzy level set method was introduced for identifying the boundaries of fluid filled regions on B-scans (x and y-axes) and C-scans (z-axis). The boundaries identified from three types of scans were combined to generate a comprehensive volumetric segmentation of retinal fluid. Then, artefactual fluid regions were removed using morphological characteristics and by identifying vascular shadowing with OCT angiography obtained from the same scan. The accuracy of retinal fluid detection and quantification was evaluated on 10 eyes with diabetic macular edema. Automated segmentation had good agreement with manual segmentation qualitatively and quantitatively. The fluid map can be integrated with OCT angiogram for intuitive clinical evaluation.},

  abstract      = {IMPORTANCE: Macular ischemia is a key feature of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Quantification of macular ischemia has potential as a biomarker for DR. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of automated quantification of capillary nonperfusion as a potential sign of macular ischemia using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational study conducted in a tertiary, subspecialty, academic practice evaluated macular nonperfusion with 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography obtained with commercially available 70-kHz OCT and fluorescein angiography (FA). The study was conducted from January 22 to September 18, 2014. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2014, to April 7, 2015. Participants included 12 individuals with normal vision serving as controls and 12 patients with various levels of DR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preplanned primary measures were parafoveal and perifoveal vessel density, total avascular area, and foveal avascular zone as detected with 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography and analyzed using an automated algorithm. Secondary measures included the agreement of the avascular area between the OCT angiogram and FA. RESULTS: Compared with the 12 healthy controls (11 women; mean [SD] age, 54.2 [14.2] years), the 12 participants with DR (4 women; mean [SD] age, 55.1 [12.1] years) had reduced parafoveal and perifoveal vessel density by 12.6% (95% CI, 7.7%-17.5%; P < .001) and 10.4% (95% CI, 6.8%-14.1%; P < .001), respectively. Total avascular area and foveal avascular zone area were greater in eyes with DR by 0.82 mm2 (95% CI, 0.65-0.99 mm2; P = .02) and 0.16 mm2 (95% CI, 0.05-0.28 mm2; P < .001). The agreement between the vascular areas in the OCT angiogram and FA had a $\kappa$ value of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.21-0.70; P < .001). Total avascular area in the central 5.5-mm-diameter area distinguished eyes with DR from control eyes with 100% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Avascular area analysis with an automated algorithm using OCT angiography, although not equivalent to FA, detected DR reliably in this small pilot study. Further study is necessary to determine the usefulness of the automated quantification in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background—Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) smoke at higher rates than other adults and experience HIV-related and non-HIV-related adverse smoking consequences. The current study conducted a systematic review to synthesize current knowledge about gender differences in smoking behaviors among PLWH. Methods—Over three thousand abstracts from MEDLINE were reviewed and seventy-nine publications met all of the review inclusion criteria (i.e., reported data on smoking behaviors for PLWH by gender). Sufficient data were available to conduct a meta-analysis for one smoking variable: current smoking prevalence. Results—Across studies (n=51), the meta-analytic prevalence of current smoking among female PLWH was 36.3% (95% CI=28.0%-45.4%) and male PLWH was 50.3% (95% CI=44.4%-56.2%; meta-analytic OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.29-2.45). When analyses were repeated just on United States (U.S.) studies (n=23), the prevalence of current smoking was not significantly different for female PLWH (55.1%, 95% CI=47.6%-62.5%) compared to male PLWH (55.5%, 95% CI=48.2%-62.5%; meta-analytic OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.86-1.26). Few studies reported data by gender for other smoking variables (e.g., quit attempts, non-cigarette tobacco product use) and results for many variables were mixed. Discussion—Unlike the general U.S. population, there was no difference in smoking prevalence for female versus male PLWH (both >50%) indicating that HIV infection status was associated with a greater relative increase in smoking for women than men. More research is needed in all areas of smoking behavior of PLWH to understand similarities and differences by gender in order to provide the best interventions to reduce the high smoking prevalence for all genders.

Here, a high-resolution, fiberbased, visible-light optical coherence tomography system is built and used to image normal retina in rats and blood vessels in chicken embryo. In the rat retina, accurate segmentation of retinal layer boundaries and quantification of layer thicknesses are accomplished. Furthermore, three distinct capillary plexuses in the retina and the choriocapillaris are identified and the characteristic pattern of the nerve fiber layer thickness in rats is revealed. In the chicken embryo model, the microvascular network and a venous bifurcation are examined and the ability to identify and segment large vessel walls is demonstrated.},

  abstract      = {Objective: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its angiography (OCTA) have several advantages for the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, automated, complete DR classification frameworks based on both OCT and OCTA data have not been proposed. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is proposed to fulfill a DR classification framework using en face OCT and OCTA. Methods: A densely and continuously connected neural network with adaptive rate dropout (DcardNet) is designed for the DR classification. In addition, adaptive label smoothing was proposed and used to suppress overfitting. Three separate classification levels are generated for each case based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale. At the highest level the network classifies scans as referable or non-referable for DR. The second level classifies the eye as non-DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), or proliferative DR (PDR). The last level classifies the case as no DR, mild and moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and PDR. Results: We used 10-fold cross-validation with 10% of the data to assess the network&#x0027;s performance. The overall classification accuracies of the three levels were 95.7%, 85.0%, and 71.0% respectively. Conclusion/Significance: A reliable, sensitive and specific automated classification framework for referral to an ophthalmologist can be a key technology for reducing vision loss related to DR.},

Here we extend oximetry measurements to capillaries and investigate all three retinal vascular plexuses by amplifying and extracting the spectroscopic signal from each capillary segment under the guidance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Using this approach, we measured capillary sO2 in the retinal circulation in rats, demonstrated reproducibility of the results, validated the measurements in superficial capillaries with known perfusion pathways, and determined sO2 responses to hypoxia and hyperoxia in the different retinal capillary beds. OCT capillary oximetry has the potential to provide new insights into the retinal circulation in the normal eye as well as in retinal vascular diseases.},

The algorithm was validated in vitro with flow phantoms and in vivo in rats by comparing the sO 2 results, respectively, to those obtained using a blood gas analyzer and pulse oximetry.

  abstract = {Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor for glaucoma. However, the role of IOP in glaucoma progression, as well as retinal physiology in general, remains incompletely understood. We demonstrate the use of visible light optical coherence tomography to measure retinal responses to acute IOP elevation in Brown Norway rats. We monitored retinal responses in reflectivity, angiography, blood flow, oxygen saturation ( sO 2 ), and oxygen metabolism over a range of IOP from 10 to 100 mmHg. As IOP was elevated, nerve fiber layer reflectivity was found to decrease. Vascular perfusion in the three retinal capillary plexuses remained steady until IOP exceeded 70 mmHg and arterial flow was noted to reverse periodically at high IOPs. However, a significant drop in total retinal blood flow was observed first at 40 mmHg. As IOP increased, the venous sO 2 demonstrated a gradual decrease despite steady arterial sO 2 , which is consistent with increased arterial-venous oxygen extraction across the retinal capillary beds. Calculated total retinal oxygen metabolism was steady, reflecting balanced responses of blood flow and oxygen extraction, until IOP exceeded 40 mmHg, and fell to 0 at 70 and 80 mmHg. Above this, measurements were unattainable. All measurements reverted to baseline when the IOP was returned to 10 mmHg, indicating good recovery following acute pressure challenge. These results demonstrate the ability of this system to monitor retinal oxygen metabolism noninvasively and how it can help us understand retinal responses to elevated IOP.},

This algorithm is particularly suitable for the nonorthogonal wide-field OCT scan acquired by a ultrahigh-speed swept-source system (>200  kHz A-scan rate). First, the transverse motion artifacts are corrected by the between-frame registration based on en face OCT angiography (OCTA). After A-scan transverse translation between B-frames, the axial motions are corrected based on the rebuilt boundary of inner limiting membrane. Finally, a within-frame registration is performed for local optimization based on cross-sectional OCTA. We evaluated this algorithm on retinal volumes of six normal subjects. The results showed significantly improved retinal smoothness in 3-D-registered structural OCT and image contrast on en face OCTA.},

Recent studies have shown that optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), with intrinsic contrast from blood flow motion, is well suited for quantified analysis of the avascular area, which is potentially a useful biomarker in DR. In this study, we propose the first deep learning solution to segment the avascular area in OCTA of DR. The network design consists of a multi-scaled encoder-decoder neural network (MEDnet) to detect the non-perfusion area in 6 &#x00D7; 6 mm2 and in ultra-wide field retinal angiograms. Avascular areas were effectively detected in DR subjects of various disease stages as well as in the foveal avascular zone of healthy subjects.},

@article{Hormel2018,
  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Optical Society of America. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images rely on en face data projections for both qualitative and quantitative interpretation. Both maximum value and mean value projections are commonly used, and many researchers consider them essentially interchangeable approaches. On the contrary, we find that maximum value projection achieves a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio and higher image contrast across multiple vascular layers, in both healthy eyes and for each disease examined.},

@article{Wang2019a,
  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Optical Society of America. The field of view of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images of the retina can be increased by montaging consecutive scans acquired at different retinal regions. Given the dramatic variation in aberrations throughout the entire posterior pole region, it is challenging to achieve seamless merging with apparent capillary continuity across the boundaries between adjacent angiograms. For this purpose, we propose herein a method that performs automated registration of contiguous OCTA images based on invariant features and uses a novel montage algorithm. The invariant features were used to register the overlapping areas between adjacently located scans by estimating the affine transformation matrix needed to accurately stitch them. Then, the flow signal was compensated to homogenize the angiograms with different brightness and the joints were blended to generate a seamless, montaged wide-field angiogram. We evaluated the algorithm on normal and diabetic retinopathy eyes. The proposed method could montage the angiograms seamlessly and provided a wide-field of view of retinal vasculature.},
